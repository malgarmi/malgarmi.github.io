We were headed off to MSJ because we wanted better insight on how to publish a good newspaper. After waiting about an hour for the bus and enduring the chaotic bus ride, we finally arrived at MSJ. During the duration of the field trip, we learned about</span><span class="c5 c10">&nbsp;The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c8 c5">, from how writers write their articles to how they keep organization of their large class. The information learned is priceless to us, and we hope future Mustang journalists follow in their footsteps.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c22 c10 c25"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.hme9wcazdmyf"><span class="c10 c12">The Way There</span></h2><p class="c20"><span class="c5 c13">Third period had started as usual, students seated into their usual seats and did the do-now. We reviewed the 14 questions we had created the day before. Everyone was assigned a question to ask the Smokies (that&rsquo;s what the newspaper&rsquo;s staff calls themselves). </span><span class="c5 c8">After finishing all of our work, we put on our backpacks and headed for the cafeteria. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c8 c5">Mr. Algarmi announced that we had fifteen minutes for lunch. A few students chose to display their amazing taekwondo moves, while another created a sugar &lsquo;pizza&rsquo;. Once our time was up, we cleaned-up and got ready to move out of Centerville. As the class stood before the green bushes, we formed a line, waiting for the bus. As 10:25 neared, the shoulders of students ached as many people put down their backpacks.Soon enough, when no bus was in sight, &nbsp;Mr. Algarmi, confused, called the bus department. As it happened, they had forgotten about our month-in-advance booking. Now, they decided to call a bus in order to pick us up. &nbsp;Everyone was shocked and annoyed at the news. Our conversations continued, now talking about bikes and screws on the ground. In due time, the fourth period had ended and we were still all standing on the sidewalk in front of Centerville, not yet at Mission San Jose High as expected. The bus took a long time to come. Everybody jumped at every vehicle they saw - we thought a public bus, an old Volkswagen van, and even a monster truck was our bus.</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c8 c5">Finally, after an irritating amount of time, the bus arrived! Talking about our seats on the bus, everyone squeezed in. Though the bus was narrow, nobody was knocked over. After we settled in, the ride started. Though the ride was bumpy, everyone was having fun. The back of the bus was loud and wild - meanwhile, in the front of the bus, three kids, Mr. Algarmi, and the bus driver were engaged in a casual, mellow conversation.</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c5">&nbsp;By the end of our ride, we were breathless from laughter. As we neared the turn into MSJ&rsquo;s parking lot, the small cars were dwarfed by the extremely tall bus. As we climbed down the steep steps of the bus we were headed towards their classroom. We walked while observing the towering, fresh-looking school. As we headed towards </span><span class="c5 c10">The Smoke </span><span class="c5 c10">Signal&rsquo;</span><span class="c5">s</span><span class="c8 c5">&nbsp;classroom, we noticed that the school was astonishingly tidy and well-kept. From the benches to bathrooms, the ground and walls to even the trash cans, the whole school was surprisingly neat.</span></p><h2 class="c23" id="h.1n8eyybjk20s"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 379.00px; height: 207.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 379.00px; height: 379.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -83.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h2><h2 class="c3" id="h.suy5t1uj837a"><span class="c10 c22">The Experience </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c8 c5 c13">&nbsp;was established in 1965, while our newspaper was only started in 2020. Therefore, we decided to go on a field trip to their school so we could learn their methods and ask for advice. We had been planning on visiting their newspaper team ever since October. In the end, we succeeded in securing a field trip on November 18. The school was huge - it had lots of buildings, a bell tower, several gardens, and even a statue. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c13">As we entered the classroom, we noticed that there was a big painting of </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c8 c5 c13">&rsquo;s logo on the wall. The room was also filled with desks - we sat on one side of the room, the Smokies on the other. The whiteboard was written on to read, &nbsp;&ldquo;HELLO CENTERVILLE JOURNALISTS!&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c13">Their journalism team and classroom was quite different from ours. The classroom itself was dedicated to their newspaper team, which consisted of over 50 people compared to our measly 21. Everyone worked individually compared to us, and it felt like this was not an elective course but rather a job. We saw that our desks had printed issues of </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal </span><span class="c8 c5 c13">on top of them, three on each for us to keep. Their printed paper had colorful sections, and was greatly informative.Some people gave delicious refreshments such as M&amp;M cookies, pretzel sticks, and iced tea. The preparation put into the field trip showed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c13">The Editors-in-Chief, the editors, and the staff writers showed us how they chose the writers in their topic. Later, the teacher and the Editors-in-Chief answered our fourteen questions. We learned that their website gets thousands of views! The class had also shown us a well-animated advertisement video for </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c5 c13">. After we saw that, we were asked to do an activity, where we wrote a section for </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c5 c13">. We were put into groups, and were taught tips on how to write favorable articles. The Smokies&rsquo; way of writing articles varied from how we wrote articles; they went through many more rough drafts (about four or five, while we usually only </span><span class="c5 c13">go through</span><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;one or two) and generally didn&#39;t have questions as their hooks. This experience helped us develop a further understanding about how to write clear, succinct articles.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.2437fv35gclm"><span class="c17 c10">The Smoke Signal Process</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c8 c5 c13">&rsquo;s class structure is a social pyramid. At the very top is the teacher. Right underneath her are the Editors-in-Chief, and underneath the Editors-in-Chief are the 16 editors, two per section/topic. These editors are the News, Opinion, Feature, Centerspread, A&amp;E (Arts &amp; Entertainment), Sports, Graphics, and Web Editors. Finally, underneath the editors are the 32 staff writers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c8 c5 c13">&rsquo;s process for selecting who writes what is significantly different from ours. Our process, called the lottery system, works with Each group getting a piece of paper to write down a numbered list of all the topics we&rsquo;d prefer to write about, 1 being our most preferred and 7 being our least preferred. Mr. Algarmi randomly selects who gets what topic, trying to give each group something in their top three. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c13">However, </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal </span><span class="c8 c5 c13">uses a process named the stand-up pitch, a far more specific process to choose each group&rsquo;s topic. The staff writers and editors come up with topics, and the editors-in-chief narrow the list down. In class, the editors-in-chief announce the topics, and if a writer wants to write about the topic, they stand up and make a pitch about why they are the best writer for the job. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5 c13">The writers use Google Docs to write their articles, similar to us. However, unlike us, they write in a column format. Their articles are usually about 100 lines long.</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.f68gqwfglmkg"><span class="c17 c10">Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c13">We did not have very much time, and when we left, it felt as though we had just arrived. &nbsp;Over the next following days, we reviewed the advice </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c5 c13">&rsquo;s staff had given us. We incorporated the writing skills we learned from them into our own articles. One thing we will implement from </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c5 c13">&rsquo;s process is the stand-up pitch, which will be used by Semester Two Journalism students and all Journalism students after that. We greatly enjoyed the trip, and we give thanks to </span><span class="c4">The Smoke Signal</span><span class="c8 c5 c13">&nbsp;for taking time out for us and giving us this opportunity. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c8 c19"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11"></span></p></body></html>

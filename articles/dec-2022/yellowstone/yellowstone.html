I&#39;ve experienced Yellowstone myself and it showed me just how breathtaking nature can be. I went to Yellowstone with my family and friends. If you&#39;re one of those people who think nature is a joke, you&rsquo;ll change your mind after reading this! During the trip I wrote all about Yellowstone in a journal. I will share the highlights of my trip and a few of my journal entries, so that one day you can consider going to Yellowstone too!</span></p><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">We See Exploding Geysers (Midway Geyser Basin)&#x1f62e;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 264.67px; height: 198.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 264.67px; height: 198.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Midway Geyser Basin was the first place I visited when I came to Yellowstone. After a quick breakfast and playing tag, we got in the van and went to this amazing place. Here&rsquo;s what happened when I arrived with my family friends:</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 286.50px; height: 214.88px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 286.50px; height: 214.88px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I arrived at The </span><span class="c2">Midway Geyser Basin</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and this was nature at its best! There were geysers all around us. The lava&rsquo;s heat could still be felt near the </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 178.50px; height: 238.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 178.50px; height: 238.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">geysers signaling that the lava was close to the surface. The geysers spewed out from the little pools of blue hot water. Geysers are the result of volcanic eruptions and when the magma comes out, it becomes lava. Although, the geyser itself smelled like rotten eggs. I looked at two more geysers in the murky brown area. The two kept exploding brown mud repeatedly. The last destination in Midway Geyser Basin was a large great geyser. It shot up at least 200 feet in the air! We left quickly as inhaling the smoke that the geyser was releasing apparently had harmful chemicals which were dangerous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As you can see, Midway Geyser Basin was a very colorful and beautiful place. I learned a lot and the pictures are magnificent. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4 c13">We Go on a Hike Against the Law (Rushing Rapids)&#x1f608;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">In this part of my journal, I went on a hike against the law. Well it was probably against the law, but I&rsquo;m not sure. You&rsquo;ll understand it better when you read this.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c20">&nbsp;&ldquo;Eventually, we stopped at a parking lot isolated from the road and sat on some logs to eat lunch. Suddenly, one of my uncles stood up and proposed a very bizarre idea. &lsquo;See those rapids over there guys? Let&#39;s </span><span class="c0">hike down this small mountain and see what&#39;s over there. I&#39;m sure this will be easy as pie.&rsquo; I was completely against the idea, but as I saw my friends slowly making their way down, I just knew I couldn&rsquo;t miss out! I finished my lunch and jumped up. I took a look at the slope for the first time and my stomach flipped. It definitely didn&rsquo;t look easy as pie and I was 100% sure this was against the law.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I might have been exaggerating just a little bit when I was talking about the hike being illegal. The reason why it might have been illegal is the ground wasn&rsquo;t smooth, the trees were spiky, &nbsp;jagged rocks everywhere, and no one else was going there. So obviously it had to be illegal right? </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 160.00px; height: 265.41px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 204.00px; height: 270.00px; margin-left: -44.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;After thinking of the million possible ways to die, I took a deep breath and joined the others as they made their way down. The hike was easier said than done. I must have slipped nearly 20 times! One of my sister&rsquo;s friends helped me down halfway. I bit my tongue, and every time I took a step, my anxiety rose. Over the twigs, past the rocks, and to the big jump. I stopped and my heart </span><span class="c2">raced</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;when I saw the jump.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to jump down there?!&rdquo; I yelled, frustrated. All the possibilities of dying came back to me as I stood on the 2-foot-high rock.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well. . . it&rsquo;s not that bad,&rdquo; said my uncle who suggested the bizarre idea. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 219.64px; height: 293.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 219.64px; height: 293.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">I wanted to argue further, but everyone else was lining up behind me. I came this far and now there was no going back. With an angry sigh I took my big leap. I stuttered when I fell, losing my balance completely, but regained it just as fast. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">I gasped in disbelief. I had actually just survived that! In the corner of my eye I caught sight of the rushing rapids and realized I had made it! Just as I was about to jump for joy, reality struck me. I wasn&rsquo;t done yet.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a humongous, misshapen rock in the middle of the rushing rapids. A log with holes in it was fashioned as a bridge from the rocky land to the &nbsp;big rock. I groaned, but at the same time I was intrigued to see the view from there. One of the uncles helped me across the makeshift bridge and to my surprise, the log was actually pretty steady. It felt relaxing more than scary. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled for the first time during the hike. I had made it and it had been worth it. As I turned around to face the rapids, I came </span><span class="c2">face-to-face</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with the most majestic waterfall ever. I just couldn&rsquo;t resist taking out my phone and snapping pictures of the waterfall. My sister&rsquo;s friend, Haritha, took a picture of me standing on the rock. In a few minutes, everyone had joined me on the rock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience on this forbidden hike was scary, but in the end it was worth it. As you can tell, this was a very dangerous and crazy adventure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Mammoth Hot Springs and Some Adorable </span><span class="c4">Encounters</span><span class="c12">&#x1f970;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 192.50px; height: 256.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 192.50px; height: 256.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">When we were driving over to our next destination, Mammoth Hot Springs, I fell asleep in the stuffed up van which is pretty surprising. But for the record I was exhausted after the first two adventures I had taken. Anyways after Mammoth HotSprings we ran into some adorable encounters, so now I&rsquo;ll leave you to it.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c6">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I woke up just as we reached the next destination-Mammoth Hot Springs. There were high mountains with water spilling through. All the mini mountains were different colored and at first look I thought those were their natural colors. But when I looked closer, I realized that the water was brown, and sometimes even red on some of the mountains. The water was changing the color of the mountains! There were red, green, brown, and so many other colors.My friends and I walked on a long wooden staircase that kept going higher and higher with the mountains following.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 178.25px; height: 238.05px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 178.25px; height: 238.05px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Soon I reached 6,000 feet altitude. Now my friends and I stood on a platform and the highest point and waited for the parents and our elder siblings to join us. From up here, I could see all the colorful mountains, and the waters slowly trickling down from them. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the group slowly made their way up. Soon after we had to leave, but on the way we had some unexpected encounters. We saw a car stop on the road and so we got out of our van too to see what everyone was looking at. Oh my Gosh, it was a baby black bear in the distance! I stood at the edge of the cliff and zoomed in on my phone as much as I could. I caught a blur of black surrounded by grass and trees in the photo. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">After a few more minutes we got back in the van, only to encounter another amazing sight! This time we saw a big, brown bison laying down in a field of grass. It was so close to us. I took a picture of it from inside the van, but then one of the uncle&rsquo;s urged me forward and I got out of the van. I stood barely 10 feet away from the bison. It wagged its tail and turned its head to eye me. Heart racing, I quickly snapped a picture of it and ran back inside the van. I sighed with relief when I got back inside and soon we were on our way back to our rented log house.&rdquo;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 214.50px; height: 286.26px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 214.50px; height: 286.26px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Even though I fell asleep before this adventure, I&rsquo;d say this was the best adventure yet because I didn&rsquo;t sleep through it. Mammoth Hot Springs was colorful and cool, but my personal favorite was the baby bear and the bison. These unexpected encounters were a great way to end the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Conclusion<br></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Yellowstone was an extraordinary place. I went on many mini and humorous adventures while I was there. Midway Geyser Basin, the Rushing Rapids, Mammoth Hot Springs, the baby bear, and the bison were only a few of the animals and places I saw at Yellowstone. There are many more attractions there too, but these were my favorite. I hope one day you go to Yellowstone and experience your own adventures there too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>

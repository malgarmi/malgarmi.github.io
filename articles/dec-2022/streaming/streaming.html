However, its reputation in the music industry is a very broad subject, with some of the biggest artists in the world having expressed their views and opinions on it. Like Taylor Swift, who in 2014 removed her catalog from Spotify, eventually returning in 2017 and having a love-hate relationship with the company ever since. So why is it disliked by musicians?

Soon after that, Starworks was established by Starlight Networks and allowed people to access MPEG-1 full-motion videos via corporate Ethernet networks. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until 1999 that the music industry broke out in the form of Napster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a peer-to-peer file sharing network, Napster allowed people to upload and download MP3 files. This format of code contains compressed sound that could be replayed to the liking of its owner. It was one of the first forms of free &ldquo;music streaming&rdquo;, and at the time it was running garnered millions of users. But, in 2001, Napster would face lawsuits regarding copyright infringement and fair use laws due to the sharing of music without the consent of its creators. Years later, Napster would be bought out by another company called Rhapsody, which is known as the first paid streaming service. Rhapsody had a catalog composed of licensed music from labels like Universal Records and allowed people to listen to it if they paid a monthly fee.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 367.11px; height: 206.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 367.11px; height: 206.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years following Rhapsody, more streaming services have launched, most notably ones like Apple Music, Pandora, and Spotify, all of which have established their presence in the industry.

class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Centerville is finishing the first semester of 2022-2023! Centerville has been a new experience for all students, both for those entering and those returning. We are almost halfway through the school year. Many students may not know what happened in the past semester that didn&rsquo;t involve them, including what happened in different electives, clubs, sports events, and school events. So let&rsquo;s break it down; the girls&#39; volleyball team season is over, most students will get brand-new electives, numerous school events have passed, and much more. We will get insights into students&#39; lives from different electives and clubs.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c16 c17" id="h.kre9iiv4h9k4"><span class="c7">Electives</span></h1><p class="c16"><span class="c11 c10">Design &amp; Modeling </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c6">Design &amp; modeling is taught by Mr. Olson and is an elective where students learn how to design and print 3D various creations using computers. One of the students taking this elective class is 7th grader Alex Labrutto.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">If one is interested in engineering, one should take this elective, says Alex. &ldquo;You get to work on SketchUp, sometimes blender if you choose it, and overall, it&#39;s just fun to do.&rdquo; In case one is interested in this elective but has no prior knowledge or experience, know that one will be taught everything in this elective. Alex and several other students had no idea what they were doing for this elective, but still managed to understand and catch on what they needed to do quickly. &ldquo;You will learn it [knowledge needed for this elective] on the way, that&#39;s kind of what I did. I didn&#39;t know some of the stuff but I learned it throughout the year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c11 c10">French</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French is a year-long elective that is taught by Mrs. Garner. The students that take French learn how to speak and write the language. One of these students is 8th grader Anay Pinto. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In order to fully participate in French, you need passion and skill, says Anay. &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">You need passion. Skills are just basic reading and writing of course. If you can speak and read English then you are all set to learn french. It&#39;s just that you need to actually want to learn French. Of course, as foreign languages are difficult to learn,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;really need to pay attention and do your best to learn. If you don&#39;t pay attention, then it&#39;s easy to fail!&rdquo; Anay plans to use French as a way to get into colleges and to help his family tour Europe. &ldquo;</span><span class="c6 c0">I plan to use this elective in the future to help me secure positions in ivy league colleges, and a less academic goal is when I tour Europe with my family. I want to be able to go with knowledge and confidence to be able to speak to locals in France, so that I can help our family understand where the best places to eat are, etc.&rdquo; he says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c11 c10">Concert Band</span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 543.00px; height: 203.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 543.00px; height: 203.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">There are over fifty people in the concert band, so two interviews of different instrument categories are required. Concert band is a band without string instruments. It&#39;s taught after school by Ms. Mitchell, the band teacher at Washington High school. She teaches choir, marching band, jazz, symphonic, and concert band at Washington High School. The first interviewee, Elysae Hann, is a 7th grade tenor saxophone player who joined the band this year. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In order to fully participate </span><span class="c0">in band</span><span class="c6 c0">, one needs to have at least a minimal amount of musical knowledge to not struggle. &ldquo;If you don&#39;t have any instrument experience, it would not be as easy. It would make it a little more difficult to learn how to play the instrument,&rdquo; she explains. Elysae plans to use her experience and talent with the tenor saxophone to make money as a possible side job in the future. &ldquo;Um, maybe a way to make more money like it&rsquo;s a concert,&rdquo; Elysae explains. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The second interviewee is Jeremy Chen, a 7th grader who has played percussion for about 7 years. Unlike </span><span class="c0">Elysae</span><span class="c0">, Jeremy thinks that you don&rsquo;t need any prior skills or passions to fully participate </span><span class="c0">in band</span><span class="c6 c0">. &ldquo;Everybody can join,&rdquo; he says. His advice to new band members is to &ldquo;Get ready to learn.&rdquo; In general, his advice would apply to all electives. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c10">Publications &amp; Yearbook</span><span class="c11 c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In addition to the Mustang Round-up video, which summarizes what happened over the previous month, publications </span><span class="c0">is responsible</span><span class="c6 c0">&nbsp;for making the yearbook every year. They communicate with the public, in this case the Centerville staff and students. Mr. Rhodes is in charge of publications. A student that takes this elective is 7th grader Taylor Thompson.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Taylor advises that anyone who wants to join publications should, as long as they are okay with taking photos of people and contacting others. &ldquo;In publications, you get to design a yearbook page and write an article. You need to enjoy taking photos of people and be comfortable emailing and interviewing them,&rdquo; she explains. Taylor says if you want to be a designer or photographer, it would be ideal to do publications &amp; yearbooks. &ldquo;I think this would be useful if people wanted to work on designing or taking photos.&rdquo; </span></p><h1 class="c12" id="h.g2n3n95ehl11"><span class="c11 c7"></span></h1><h1 class="c16 c17" id="h.6ho0qeg1trj4"><span class="c11 c7">Girls&rsquo; Volleyball </span></h1><p class="c21"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 500.00px; height: 147.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 500.00px; height: 147.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">The girls&#39; volleyball team started with tryouts in late July. Once the participants were chosen, they were split into two teams, team A and team B. The teams are coached by Lauren and Renee and started in October. Both the A and B team had a successful season with team A winning about 4 games and team B winning 6. And to top off the semester, they ended their season with a student versus staff game. The staff won the first round, the girls won the second. The first game was at Horner Middle school, both the A and B team won. The second game was at Centerville, where the girls played against Walters. Team A unfortunately lost but Team B won. The third game was at Hopkins Junior High School where both teams lost. The fourth game was against Thornton where Team A lost but Team B had won. The girls played these four teams twice with similar scores. One of the players is Josie, a 7th grade former volleyball player from Team A. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">A few highlights from the volleyball season include games, team bonding, and practices. &ldquo; I mean, &nbsp;volleyball throughout the whole season was really fun. Some highlights - the games were really fun. Sometimes just hanging out with your teammates is really fun, like with the activities we do. There&#39;s also fun games that we did during practices,&rdquo; says Josie. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Although the volleyball games were fun, there were still pros and cons. &ldquo;So ups were just hanging out with your teammates like winning games, those are definitely ups and some downs might be losing the games. Some people got injured but that&#39;s really rare. So those are some of the downs.&rdquo; One of these injuries included Nishka&rsquo;s finger injury. She unfortunately broke her finger while attempting to receive a volleyball. Luckily, this was the last game, so she didn&rsquo;t miss any other volleyball-related activities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Going into volleyball, Josie had no experience. She wanted to try something new and thought of it as a fun hobby. &nbsp;&ldquo;My mindset was just this was like a random thing I was going to try &lsquo;cause before I hadn&#39;t done any volleyball things, it was just a fun little hobby. But then once you actually get into going on a team, then it&#39;s more serious not but you could still have fun while doing it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">In order to fully participate in volleyball, passion, prior knowledge, and some skill is required. &ldquo;I&#39;d say you have to have some skill going into volleyball or some common knowledge about volleyball before going in. Just because if there&#39;s other teammates who are really serious about this, you wouldn&#39;t want to bring them down.&rdquo; These are words from a team player.</span></p><h1 class="c24" id="h.289prax36ahv"><span class="c26">School Events</span></h1><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 144.59px; height: 116.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 144.59px; height: 116.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">There were many school events that took place here at Centerville. Including the dances, kindness month, and red ribbon week. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Aloha dance was on September 26th and it was the first dance of the 2022-2023 school year. Many people attended, having a fun time and checking out the dance. The second dance was the Halloween Dance on October 31st. This dance, students were allowed to dress-up and wear their costumes. Less people attended but those who did had a memorable time. Both of these dances started at about 3:</span><span class="c0">00pm</span><span class="c6 c0">&nbsp;and lasted until 5:00pm and the tickets were $5. The third dance is the Winter Wonderland Dance. This dance was on December 9th from 7:00pm to 9:00pm with a ticket price of $8. Even with the raised price and later time, many people still attended. This dance was also different from the others. There was a photo booth and you could purchase glow sticks. With it being at a later time, the cafeteria was dark and many colored lights were on. This seemed to be a favorite dance to many students. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">Kindness month was the whole month of October when students were encouraged to be extra kind. Each day, students from leadership said a kindness quote in the morning announcements. There was also a cart set up near room F106 where students could come and write a kind note for a friend or teacher. </span></p><p class="c5 c25"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c16 c17" id="h.9ssyrliv1s3h"><span class="c7">Clubs and Club Events</span></h1><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 133.00px; height: 116.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 133.00px; height: 116.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">The merit club is a service club and is supervised by Mrs. Fields. One of the highlights of the merit club was Red Ribbon week, says Mrs. Fields. Red Ribbon Week is probably the most well known merit club event. Red ribbon week was a week to spread awareness of drugs and to say &lsquo;NO&rsquo;. Drugs aren&rsquo;t good for you and many schools try to get that point across through a red ribbon week. At Centerville, the merit club created red beaded necklaces that students could purchase. Sometimes, you would get an extra prize along with your necklace. One of these prizes was a &lsquo;say no to drugs&rsquo; dog tag. One of the students from this service club is Akshita Boppudi. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">There are several benefits if one is interested in joining the merit club. One of them is the ability to skip the lunch line and go on exclusive field trips. Although these benefits seem great, you still need to work for a certain amount of hours to obtain it. &ldquo;If you join the merit club and do 25 hours of service work, you would get VIP benefits such as a free pass through the lunch line. And also you get to go on VIP only events and field trips,&rdquo; she explains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">No skills or passions are needed to participate in the merit club. One just needs to be willing to participate. &ldquo;You just need to be there for most of the meetings and know and mostly participate in most of the activities we do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 345.00px; height: 194.45px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 345.00px; height: 194.45px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">DND, or Dungeons and Dragons, is a role playing board game. You get to play as a character you make and go on perilous adventures. Recently, Mr. Benson created a club for this game. Many people have joined this club. One of these people is 7th grade Jade Meyer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c0">She says if you like to roleplay as other characters and have a creative mind, this club would be perfect for you. &ldquo;If you&#39;re a big nerd, it would be perfect for you. I&#39;m kidding, anyone can join and it&#39;s a very fun board game. If you like games that let you roleplay as another character, it would be a fun club for you to join.&rdquo; She explains you don&rsquo;t need any passions or skills to participate in DND. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need any skills or passions. In fact, I just joined because it sounded enjoyable and fun.

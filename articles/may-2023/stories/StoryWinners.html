Both Rowan and Noah stepped outside the convenience store. Today was another hot day after school, and the temperature was as hot as the sun. Both students made their way onto the bench and sat down. &nbsp;Rowan unwrapped his popsicle as Noah looked at him in worry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;How&#39;s high school? Better than middle school?&rdquo; Rowan questioned, taking a bite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Yeah, school&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Noah answered half-heartedly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;What&#39;s wrong?&rdquo; Rowan asked without looking away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re okay? Did nothing happen in the mountains when you were missing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">It had already been a few weeks since Rowan had disappeared, but Noah was still worried. The blond-haired boy smiled as if he was consoling a puppy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fine. Now eat your popsicle before it starts melting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Not realizing Rowan had ignored his second question, Noah hesitantly opened his popsicle and took a bite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already been a few months, but you haven&rsquo;t attended school. How come?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Aww, were you missing me? I can imagine poor Noah crying, &lsquo;Rowan won&rsquo;t come to school!&rsquo;&rdquo; Rowan laughed, his glasses sliding down his nose.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Hey, cut it out!&rdquo; Noah smiled. &ldquo;Still&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I told you, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah took another bite, his gaze on Rowan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that&hellip; you&rsquo;re so different from before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rowan stopped as a bead of sweat trickled down his forehead. He averted his gaze to his popsicle and chuckled nervously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just imagining things. I&rsquo;m still your best friend!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He looked back and elbowed Noah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah grinned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Splat!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">His popsicle fell to the ground, some parts still on the stick.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;re probably right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">* * *</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, mum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah said, taking off his shoes at the entrance of his home. His mother appeared from the hallway in her yellow apron, a ladle in hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Hey, hun. How was school? You&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I was just hanging out with Rowan after school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Uhm, alright hun.&rdquo; His mother had an awkward smile, her expression one of worry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah climbed up the stairs and into his room. It was a simple bedroom with a plain bed and desk. Noah wasn&rsquo;t too keen on decorating. He only owned a framed picture of him and Rowan in middle school on his desk. Noah smiled, pulling out his homework while looking at that picture.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;It had already been four hours after he got home when Noah realized it had gotten late. Suddenly, a noise rang in his head. It was akin to the noise of a bell, he realized. It rang repeatedly, the sound shrieking in his mind. Along with the bell, another noise started. It was a sentence, Noah realized. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU SEE A CLASSMATE GETTING BULLIED?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah covered his ears and ground his teeth, wishing this would all be over.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;NOTHING!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Finally, when Noah collapsed on his bed, it stopped. He groaned in annoyance and sat up. Noah reached for his bedside table and pulled out a pill bottle. It read Aripiprazole. Noah shook out a few and swallowed it, laying back on his bed. He shut his eyes, his breath light. Noah thought about Rowan, and how he reacted after what Noah had said. Soon, his conscience drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Hey, Pass the ball!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Middle school students yelled at Rowan as he ran with the soccer ball, narrowly missing the other team members. Once near, he took one powerful kick and scored a goal. His team members rushed him with praise. Sitting on the sidelines, Noah smiled as everyone beside him cheered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan is so cool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;He is so cute as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;You think he&rsquo;s going to become a pro soccer player?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">They all agreed that Rowan would be a fantastic athlete in the future, and at one point Noah thought it too. However, this sinking feeling inside his stomach wouldn&rsquo;t stop. Despite the bright sky, clear weather, and happy expressions everyone had, Noah couldn&rsquo;t help but have a strange feeling in his gut, like this was going wrong. Noah flinched at the sound of the bell. Wide-eyed, he looked up at the bell tower, the ringing getting louder and louder.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He muttered uncontrollably. His eyebrows lowered, his mouth trying to utter a sentence. Noah&rsquo;s body shook, and he forced his eyes off the tower to the ground. Hunched over he hugged his stomach, sweat dripping from his forehead. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;...Sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">That last word came out as a small whisper. Noah was lying on his side in bed, his arms tightly wrapped around his body. He was shivering.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah sat up and put his palm on his forehead.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">That dream again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He thought, sighing as he got up to get ready for school.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">* * *</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">In the peaceful campus of Redwood High School, everything in the classrooms is supervised and taken care of by the class representatives. However, Kaiya recently noticed something strange. A boy in her classroom has been acting differently than normal. Compared to the start of the year, Noah Gray has been looking a lot more&ndash; rough, &ndash;as she calls it. The dark circles under his eyes have worsened, his black hair has gotten longer, and he hasn&rsquo;t been eating lunch. Not at school, at least. Having a strong sense of responsibility, she asked some classmates if they had any information on Noah. The only thing she heard? An incident in middle school that happened right before summer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;It was crazy.&rdquo; One friend explained.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I heard it was really bad.&rdquo; Another expressed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;No one saw the car coming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">But that was all she could find. No one had explained what happened or knew what happened. Although, one name kept popping up&ndash; Rowan Ellis. He was described as a boy with blonde hair and glasses. Rowan peaked in middle school, but she heard he had disappeared a few weeks ago. Other than that, she was sure he didn&rsquo;t attend Redwood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">After school, Kaiya trudged through the road of her small town. A corner store was just a few blocks from the school, and a popsicle sounded good in the warm weather. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Just as she rounded the block, she came upon a strange sight. Kaiya encountered Noah, except he was smiling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">She inched closer, determined to see what he was so happy about. However, nothing was there. For a moment, she stood there confused, wondering what to make of this sight. Noah was talking and smiling on an empty bench. Was this guy insane? A shiver ran down Kaiya&rsquo;s spine, and she inched backward. A gut feeling warned her about Noah, especially not to be alone with him. Whatever that was, instinctively, she stepped back. With her heart hammering in her chest, Kaiya turned and ran, her pace speeding up as she got farther away. Eventually, in a full sprint, Kaiya could hear the blood rushing to her head. She only stopped when the convenience store was far away. She didn&rsquo;t get it. She didn&rsquo;t know why she was so scared. It was just something about that sight, about how you know someone is seeing something completely different than you. Looking at Noah&rsquo;s face made her realize that he was far beyond anyone&rsquo;s reach. </span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">School meant nothing to Noah. He had average grades and didn&rsquo;t join any clubs. He had a few friends, but he was sure if he just stopped coming to school one day, they wouldn&rsquo;t notice. But Noah didn&rsquo;t care, because he still had his best friend Rowan. After school every day they would talk to each other at the convenience store, and it always seemed like Noah&#39;s troubles would all fade away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah turned the page of his book. Sitting in his seat in the Homeroom, he thought about what to eat later with Rowan. He was instead jarred out of his thoughts, confused and wondering why Kaiya, his class representative, was standing before him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah, can I&hellip; talk to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Her voice shivered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah followed her out of the classroom and into the barren hallways. No one else was there except him and Kaiya, making Noah uneasy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Kaiya kept twiddling her fingers and shifting her weight from one leg to the other. Her eyes were on the ground and she never made eye contact with him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Listen, Noah, what do you do after school every day?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Stunned by this question, he hesitated before answering,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I hang out with my friend. Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;who is this friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Shocked, Kaiya stepped back like she had seen a ghost. Her eyes were wide, and her tone was grim.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;But&hellip; I heard Rowan was dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah froze, a shudder going through his body.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;No&hellip; NO!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He ran up and grabbed Kaiya&rsquo;s shoulders.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I know, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. It&rsquo;s not like that! He&rsquo;s not&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;He disappeared two weeks ago!&rdquo; Kaiya yelled with her eyes closed. &ldquo;He&hellip; disappeared two weeks ago&hellip;&rdquo; She repeated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah let go, and she collapsed on the ground, shuddering. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s real,&rdquo; Noah muttered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan is&hellip; there.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah&rsquo;s yelling had alerted his classmates, and now people were beginning to crowd them. Unsure what to do, Noah&rsquo;s only goal was to get out of there. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Sprinting out of the school and off campus, Noah ran to the convenience store where Rowan would be. It was too early, but Noah was determined to wait for him. He had to see him again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Maybe Kaiya was right&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Sitting on the bench, Noah shook his head and clenched his fist.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">No! I saw him yesterday! He was right in front of me! They&#39;re all wrong!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He hunched over, covering his face with his hands.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He was right there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Hours went, way past the time they were supposed to meet. For some odd reason, Rowan had never let Noah stay with him after dark, but until nightfall, Noah stayed there, sitting on the bench, solely waiting for Rowan.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Ding! The owner shuffled out of the store, getting ready to close up for the night. Glancing over to the bench, she jumped in surprise at the sight of Noah, sitting on the bench lifeless. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Has he been here since the morning?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">The owner inched closer and tapped her finger on his shoulder. He flinched and looked around before facing her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Oh&hellip; Hey Ms. Millian. Is Rowan here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;...I think it&#39;s time for you to go home.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">She replied.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;What? Why? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Just go, kid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Wait! I still need to&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;GO!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah flinched at her yelling and started to get up to leave. </span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Arriving at his house, he started taking his shoes off at the entrance when the sound of talking started. Noah peeked into the living room to see his parents, not aware he was home. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;It seems like nothing is working&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">His mother sobbed, her hands covering her face. Noah&rsquo;s father had a grim expression on his face, his hand patting her back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everything is alright.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">His father chided. Sensing danger, Noah left and quietly crept up the stairs and into his room. Even though he shut and locked the door, he could still hear his mothers crying.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Nothing is &lsquo;alright&rsquo;! Don&rsquo;t you know what he said?&rdquo; His mother cried. &ldquo;Noah said&hellip; he met Rowan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">His father sighed, exasperated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Ever since he went to the mountains with Rowan&hellip; nothing has been the same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&hellip;&rdquo; His mother let out a sob.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying, honey. Perhaps&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah sat down and leaned against the door, his eyes locked onto the floor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know how embarrassed I am to have a hallucinating son?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah shut his eyes tight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rowan is not a hallucination. He&rsquo;s real&hellip; am I the problem? Why do I have to be so useless? Why am I like this? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah had never asked to be this way. He had never asked to be himself, so why does it hurt so much?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah? Your home pretty late&hellip;are you hungry? Should I cook something up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">His mother called.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not hungry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah&rsquo;s voice shook.</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah didn&rsquo;t go back to school. He simply couldn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t handle all the stares, all the questions. Every single day. Every single day he had to go to school and sit there, sit there feeling empty, sit there and feel guilty for just existing. He hated every single second, every single minute of being alive. Noah didn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep, he didn&rsquo;t want to wake up either. He felt alone because Noah knew they were no other person who felt this way. And he knew he shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling this way. He has loving parents, a home, and a best friend. But there was just something about waking up in the morning and staring outside the window, wishing he could be someone different. A person who&rsquo;s not crazed up in the head. Maybe then he wouldn&rsquo;t be such a burden to his parents. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s enough that he causes them so much stress. He didn&rsquo;t need to cause them any more trouble. But Noah knew if he ever committed, his mother would cry. And he didn&rsquo;t know how to handle that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;At 3:10, Noah crept out to wait for Rowan. He needed something to take his mind off, to reassure himself that he was right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rounding the corner, Noah&rsquo;s eyes were locked on the bench by the store. To his relief. There he was, a blonde boy with glasses was sitting on the bench. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah&rsquo;s eyes lit up as his worries faded away. He sprinted to Rowan, clasping him in a tight hug. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah sighed in relief. Rowan was real. He felt real. Noah knew it was all lies. Why would Rowan ever lie to him?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">After calming down, Noah told Rowan the whole story, how Kaiya had lied about Rowan&rsquo;s death and how his parents didn&rsquo;t believe him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah expected Rowan&rsquo;s reaction to be one of anger or surprise. But what he didn&rsquo;t expect was tears. Rowan was crying.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Panic overtook Noah, and his face dropped.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;ll fix it, so please don&rsquo;t cry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">It&rsquo;s just like that time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah thought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;His mind was going blank, the only thing he could think of was that scene, that scene of middle-school Noah standing outside Rowan&rsquo;s room. Noah didn&rsquo;t see him that day. The only thing he heard was crying. Rowan was crying because of Noah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that&hellip;&rdquo; Rowan sobbed. &ldquo;I just feel so helpless. I don&rsquo;t care if people make stuff up&hellip; but for you to believe them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah blurted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t believe them!&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re right here! Your real, Rowan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Then&hellip; What should we do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;We should prove to them that you&rsquo;re not dead!&rdquo; Noah grinned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Just so you don&rsquo;t seem crazy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah&rsquo;s face dropped.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rowan smiled, wiping the tears away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Nothing. I know how to do that. Hey, Noah, come and meet me in the mountains tomorrow night. Okay? That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll prove that I&rsquo;m real.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rowan patted Noah&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Whenever have I been wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">* * *</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">His mother didn&rsquo;t question it when he said he didn&rsquo;t want to go to school. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">That was the good part of being insane, I guess.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah would think. Sitting in his room and nervously tapping his finger on his leg Noah found it hard to sit still. It was finally tomorrow, the day when Noah was going to prove to everyone that he wasn&rsquo;t crazy, that Rowan was alive. He didn&rsquo;t know how he was going to prove it, but Noah trusted Rowan. Surely he didn&rsquo;t lie to him. Noah was tired of ignoring it, ignoring all the things people were saying about his best friend. He decided to finally put an end to this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t meet me in the daytime... Just go to the mountains straight away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t meet&hellip; at day&hellip; mountains straight away&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah repeated Rowan&rsquo;s words in his mind while waiting for the sun to go down. Finally, it was 7 PM, time for Noah to leave. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He burst open his door and went downstairs. Putting on his shoes, his mother appeared from the hallway.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah? What are you going this late at night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Just some things with Rowan. You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Wait, Noah&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">But before his mother could do anything, Noah was already out the door. He sprinted around the corner and past the convenience store, past the houses, and onto the path up the mountain. About to make his way up, Noah froze. Did Rowan tell him to wait or go up? Noah shook his head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He said to meet him in the mountains. He must have meant going up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Trudging up the mountain while the day was ending left Noah alone with his thoughts. He felt guilty, guilty about Rowan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Maybe today things would go back to normal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah thought, smiling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Finally, he made it to a clearing. It was a large circular area, the edge hidden by trees. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah whirled around to find no one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Maybe it was the wind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He flinched, looking in all directions. There a few feet ahead of him he found Rowan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Just as Noah took a step, Rowan darted out of the clearing and into the trees.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah ran after him, the shadows of the trees dancing and the wind laughing as the branches nicked his arms and legs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan! Wait!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">He was getting too far, and soon he was out of sight. Noah stopped and huffed, wiping away his sweat. He looked around, but Rowan was nowhere to be seen. Just as he was about to call again, a hand jumped out of the bushes and grabbed Noah&rsquo;s shirt, pulling him out and into a clearing. It was Rowan&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Rowan! What are you&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Noah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rowan spoke. Noah quieted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Why do you pretend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah&rsquo;s mouth curled into an awkward smile.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Why do you pretend to care? You didn&rsquo;t pretend back then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">There it was again, that guilty feeling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. It was my fault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah mumbled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;What was your fault?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Everything. I hurt you, Rowan. It&#39;s&hellip; all my fault&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah&rsquo;s smile dropped, and he stared at the dirt floor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the reason you can&rsquo;t play&hellip; I ignored it when they tore your stuff. I ignored it when those scars appeared&hellip;&rdquo; He clenched his fists. &ldquo;But today, I&rsquo;m going to make it up to you, so just don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Noah looked up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">The space in front of Noah wasn&rsquo;t there. He was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">&ldquo;Hate&hellip;me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c4">The wind whistled in his ear, the trees dancing in the breeze. The moon shone down as Noah slowly turned, his eyes locked on the old rotting tree behind him. Rowan had never gone down from the mountains, Noah realized. Because the decaying body in front of him with broken glasses and blonde hair was Noah&rsquo;s fault. It was all because of him. </span></p><p class="c5 title" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c6 c14">Roseanne Adaline&rsquo;s Dance With destiny</span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c12 c15">Act | : prom?</span></h2><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">*It was ironic, really.*</span></p><p class="c2 c10 c11"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">The thought implanted itself (unintentionally and uninvitingly) in Roxanne Adaline&rsquo;s head as she let out a sniffle matching the pairs of tears collected at the edge of her jaw sitting on the dark brown and comfortingly soft living room couch. The fifteen-year-old had never really felt grief before, a fortunate privilege which she will always consider herself lucky to have. But not experiencing such a strong emotion just made it hit so, so much harder. It also didn&rsquo;t help at all taking in that the person she lost was one of - if not the most - influential person in Roseanne&rsquo;s life apart from her parents: her beloved </span><span class="c3 c6">Nonna. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">She was suddenly disrupted out of her melancholy musings as she felt her father&rsquo;s tight embrace release itself and her mom following the action. You see, Roseanne wasn&rsquo;t just </span><span class="c3">sitting </span><span class="c1">on her couch, she was squished in-between the protective and almost painful grip of the two mourning parents, her mom hugging her hunched back as Rose sat practically on her dad&rsquo;s legs while she childishly, but reasonably clutched his middle. They probably looked like a family of clingy monkeys in retrospect but none of them cared as their bond grew with shared sadness. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Hey there, Rosie Posie, &rdquo; her father breathed out, obviously not surprised yet still concerned by her newly split tears. She had been crying, from silent drops to heart-wrenching sobs, for what seemed like at least a few hours but ran out of water to let out about a half-hour ago, leaving the living room full of easily punctured quietness. &ldquo;You okay, </span><span class="c3">tesoro</span><span class="c1">?&rdquo; he said, using his hands to wipe off any leftover tears from his face before doing the same for her. She couldn&rsquo;t help but lean into the touch. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Though Daniel Luca Adaline (a pretty awesome name, isn&rsquo;t it? Rose always thought it was) didn&rsquo;t live in his mother home in Italy anymore, the man remained a dedicated Italian, meaning he always found many excuses to make pizza, pasta, and spaghetti, gush about random art and philosophy facts to act smart - which never failed to annoy </span><span class="c3">Mamma-</span><span class="c1">, and always chose gelato over ice cream any day. His mom also made sure that her son learned and memorized to the bone as much of his mother tongue as possible before he moved to the US and became surrounded by English speakers. Daniel, just like his mother did for him, brought out the Italian nicknames for his child whenever in distress: when Rose was a baby and started teething which resulted in a painful day of screaming, when she fell down and skidded her knees in first grade, when she burnt her finger at 10 trying to make a Father&rsquo;s Day breakfast, and even when she grew up and was faced with the harsh reality of high school last year and needed consultation from him through soft murmurs. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Whatever good intention Daniel had was replaced with even more sorrow as Rose was knocked off her feet with the realization that the same parental nicknames her dad was calling her were identical to the ones his mother used to say - not just his mother, but her </span><span class="c3">Nonna</span><span class="c7">. She couldn&#39;t handle the sharp and somewhat physical pain that was felt in her chest as Rose&rsquo;s heart broke for her father, the man who had raised her through hardships and had now lost his mom long after losing his other parent decades before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m -&rdquo;, her tattered and broken voice tore through the awaiting silence, &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">Ahem</span><span class="c7">, I&rsquo;m just - just really going to miss </span><span class="c3">Nonna</span><span class="c1">, Pap&agrave;&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s alright to feel like that, </span><span class="c3">ragazzino</span><span class="c7">. We&rsquo;re all going to miss her a hecking lot, me, you, your </span><span class="c3">mamma</span><span class="c1">, even those two crazy best friends of yours,&rdquo; her dad said gently but firmly, making sure his daughter knew that crying was a normal and expected way to deal with loss and understand that her family and friends would always be there for her. Especially, when experiencing loss. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">He grinned when Rose couldn&rsquo;t help the snort and giggle that found its way up her throat at the mention of her friends and opened her mouth to respond with a quip to playfully defend her friends, but then furrowed her brows as she asked herself an important question. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">*Should I still go to the &lsquo;end-of-the-year&rsquo; dance today with Aurora and Flynn? I don&rsquo;t really feel in the mood to party right now; But we&rsquo;ve been planning our outfits forever and knowing them, my heart-warmingly (but sometimes stupidly) loyal best friends probably won&rsquo;t attend if I don&rsquo;t&hellip;*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sweetie? Whatcha&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; about in that brain of yours?&rdquo; Rose&rsquo;s thoughts were again interrupted but this time by her mom - well mom of 3 years after Aubrey Clara Sinter married her dad after many romantic run-ins at Daniel&rsquo;s favorite coffee shop. And unlike most of the &ldquo;step-mom scenarios&rdquo; shown on Netflix, Aubrey was great to hang out within the start of their relationship and it was only two years ago since Rose started calling her &lsquo;Mom.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Should I still go to the dance in a few hours, </span><span class="c3">Mamma</span><span class="c7">? I know I&rsquo;m still going to feel sad over </span><span class="c3">Nonna </span><span class="c7">even in a few hours but I still&hellip; I still kind of want to go and at least try to make something good of today. I mean, it&rsquo;s the school end celebration and I think that </span><span class="c3">Nonna </span><span class="c1">-&rdquo; she has to cleanse her throat when it closes up at the verbal mention of her passed grandmother. &ldquo;- she would want me to attend the dance today&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without lifting her head even an inch, Rose could tell that her parents gave each other a look over her top layer of messy and uncombed hair that still hid an even messier hidden blanket of uncombed and frizzy tangles. She could practically hear the concerned and contemplating conversation taking place back and forth between the two adults but kept quiet, desperately needing a wise answer. Rose heard and felt her dad take a deep breath and lightly extracted her from his arms before responding in what could only be described as a careful manner, &ldquo;To be honest </span><span class="c3">miele</span><span class="c7">, it&rsquo;s up to you to make that call, but don&rsquo;t think that you </span><span class="c3">have </span><span class="c1">to go to the dance in any way, shape, or form, okay? If you do, then we&rsquo;ll quickly call over your chaotic friends and have them take you to dance for a few hours before it gets too dark.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the heavy tones felt in the room, Rose grinned and huffed a laugh while jokingly smacking her dad&rsquo;s chest and retaliated, &ldquo;Stop making fun of Aurora and Flynn, </span><span class="c3">Pap&agrave;</span><span class="c1">!&rdquo;. That brought a genuine smile onto everyone on that couch&rsquo;s faces. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Okay, okay, but there&rsquo;s also another option </span><span class="c3">ragazzino</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;so listen up,&rdquo; and she hummed to display her allowance, &ldquo;we can also just order some Chinese takeout and Dominos pizza, save that amazing dress for your birthday in a few months, and maybe even call over your &lsquo;besties&rsquo; to join us in some Buzzfeed Unsolved binge-watching!&rdquo; Rose thought, as much as she loved the idea of the latter, she still wanted to have that clich&eacute; but iconic &ldquo;prom experience.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">So she mentally nodded and gathered up her courage to look up at her dad and finalize her decision, &ldquo;I wanna go, pap&agrave;; And will you help me get ready, </span><span class="c3">mamma</span><span class="c1">?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">Her dad smiled with a sense of understanding and hints of pride as Aubrey replied with strong certainty, &ldquo;Definitely, baby, I&rsquo;ll go get your outfit set up&rdquo;. Her mom got up from the couch with one last kiss to Rose&rsquo;s head as her dad cupped his child&rsquo;s cheek&rsquo;s to make sure she was listening to his next words. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Just always remember </span><span class="c3">bambina</span><span class="c7">, </span><span class="c7 c13">crying doesn&rsquo;t indicate that you&rsquo;re weak because, since birth, it&rsquo;s always been a sign that you&rsquo;re alive</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><h2 class="c10 c21" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c12 c15">Act || : prom. &nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roseanne opened her bedroom door at the light knocking to come face to face with the sympathetic and kind but excited glint in her best friends&rsquo; eyes. Just the consideration of the first two emotions she saw in them made her tear up and sniffle which was more than enough for Aurora and Flynn to fling her into a bone-crushing hug that rivaled only one of her parents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose knew that the effect of her </span><span class="c3">Nonna&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">death wasn&rsquo;t only to her own family, but also her friends since she was one of the most accepting and understanding people who immediately took both Flynn and Aurora under her wings whether they needed it or not. Rose knew this and it made her even sadder, if her non-family support system was in the same grieving boat as her, how could they help? </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Their entrance was told to her as she sat on her bed, thinking of how to talk about </span><span class="c3">Nonna </span><span class="c1">to them, should she just hug them and cry together? Or should she push aside her own troubles and just empathize with her besties instead? Or even act like it never happened? It turns out that both individuals chose the first option without her knowing as they didn&rsquo;t say a single word while the trio stood there. Only a few past Rose&rsquo;s bedroom doors into her room, they held her unyielding - as if she would crumble beneath their hovering hands if any let go, which after seeing her own mental reaction to meeting her friends, it didn&rsquo;t seem so improbable anymore. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No words were said until she parted and managed to collapse onto the bed, Rose laying in the middle, Aurora on her right, and Flynn on the opposite. Most people ask whether Aurora&rsquo;s name is actually </span><span class="c3">Aurora</span><span class="c1">, which it isn&rsquo;t, and she reveals to said person that her birth name is &lsquo;Briar.&rsquo; When the two girls first met at the start of sixth grade as they bonded over the youthful &ldquo;elementary school struggles,&rdquo; they put their names together to create &ldquo;Briar Rose&rdquo; - the true label of the famous Disney Princess &ldquo;Sleeping Beauty&rdquo; more popularly known as Aurora. The revelation was so amazing back then that Briar has gone by that title by everyone in her life, with the exception of her parents. The pair later met Flynn in their second year of middle school </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">when - </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey queen, how are we feelin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout going to this dance in less than a few hours?&rdquo;, Aurora asked, moving to sit up against the headboard with their male acquaintance &nbsp;following suit. With all the attention on her, Rose felt her head start spinning with thoughts, emotions, and a million different sentence-starters on her tongue.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Umm, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said honestly after any thought of lying to them disappeared since these were her friends who had been with her through a lot these past few years (high school was full of ups and downs). &ldquo;I want to feel excited and hyped up for this event &lsquo;cause we&rsquo;ve been waiting for it since forever but I can still detect this weighing ache in my chest that can only be described as the dramatic &lsquo;stalking storm cloud&rsquo; type emotion in my body!&rdquo; Rose didn&rsquo;t mean to raise her voice at the end and surprised herself when she did. She looked up to face her friends to apologize for yelling at the people who were only trying to help but couldn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh goodness, we know Rosie, and </span><span class="c3">my god </span><span class="c1">we are so sorry!&rdquo; Aurora burst out with tears running freely down her lightly tanned face as if she lost a battle with contradicting actions and just let herself cry for me - or us really. Before Rose could think about what she said, her friend turned to look over at Flynn which made her do the same and his face made her ragged breathing stop abruptly. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Rose could count on her both hands the number of instances she&rsquo;s seen Flynn cry and she knows it&rsquo;s because his first foster family was the opposite of friendly or parental (hence why her </span><span class="c3">Nonna </span><span class="c1">was so quick to take him under her wings) so anytime he cries or is even near crying, Rose is on high alert. He caught her eye and just huffed out a strained smile and just moved closer to her and Aurora. He opened his mouth to speak but Rose couldn&rsquo;t hold it in anymore and blurted out, &ldquo;I felt like I had to be strong for you guys.&rdquo; The eyes of the two other teens in the room widened and then their eyebrows furrowed in confusion and sadness. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my god, never would you have to act strong for us Rosie, and your misery is completely justified,&rdquo; everyone let out a weary giggle at his description bringing smirks upon his prideful face. &ldquo;But&hellip; this is getting a little too depressing for my taste and emotional capacity so do you think we can get ready now?&rdquo; he asked with poorly hidden enthusiasm and twiddling fingers. Rose and Aurora couldn&rsquo;t scold him, seeing his rare, boyish side rearing its head and because all of them knew the same thought was going through their heads. Rose nodded while rubbing away her tears and getting up to hug her wonderful besties before waving them out with a fleeting smile to change into her dress. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Taking a deep breath and softly grabbing the dress along with a pastel yellow hairband to restrain her hair when washing in the shower, Rose made her way into the bedroom&rsquo;s bathroom. Then when she came out, knowing the vanity would serve as a better mirror than the fog-covered one in the previous location, not a single thought on her outfit was conjured when her gaze fell on the separated collection of jewelry items on the desk of the vanity. The planned crescent moon hairpin, hanging star earrings, and pearl bracelet were expected but her </span><span class="c3">Nonna&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7">treasured emerald green necklace that had coincidently matched the gold of the other pieces was </span><span class="c3">unquestionably not</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t know why she got up and picked up the precious object - maybe by impulse? - and placed it on the base of her collarbone and assembled all the bravery in her to connect the hook and ending circle and looked in the mirror. She gasped and felt water in her corneas for what seemed like the millionth moment that day. Memories started flashing like the blinking of phone flashlights, echoing thunder booms after lightning strikes in a dark night, and the neon beam of her tiny light-up Sketchers. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">Her Nonna chuckling at her proud smile after kicking her small legs enough to put the soles of her feet to use&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">Nonna raising her eyebrows in surprise when she, instead of being scared of loud noises, screamed happily at the visual of lightning bolts&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">And the vivid happiness in her eyes and smile on as the flash of Rose&rsquo;s new phone temporarily blinded them&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">A choked-out gasp came out of the girl as she held the necklace close to her hand and chest and stiffened when she felt a warm hand on her shoulder offering comfort. Without a sufficient portion of time to see who it was, Rose was pulled into a mellow clasp and by the touch of dainty hands and feeling of long hair against her, she knew it was her mom. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">No words were said. Not a single one. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">But none had to be voiced as she burrowed into her </span><span class="c3">Mamma&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">long-sleeve-covered shoulder. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">She let out a final whimper and then proceeded to look up at the doorway to find the rest of her dear family: Aurora, who was wearing an absolutely stunning pink dress with puffed sleeves with complementing sky blue accessories, leaned into Flynn, who was adorned with a dark burgundy suit that greatly regarded his pale brown satin undershirt. He planted a firm hand around her waist (an action which easily made Rose raise a brow at her friends&rsquo; questionable relationship status). And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough to make her grin, her pap&agrave; wore a sheepish Cheshire cat-like smile, giving her a hilarious but touching double thumbs-up at the adorable scene in front of him. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Along with the advice he gave on the couch, he granted her another element of wisdom next to countless forehead kisses a few minutes before leaving: </span><span class="c12 c7">Healing will come in waves, one some days you&#39;ll go down and on other days you&rsquo;ll float - be patient with yourself and bandaged soul.</span></p><p class="c9 c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c10 c18" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c15 c6 c19"></span></h2><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c20 c6 c19"></span></p><h2 class="c21" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c12 c15">Act ||| : prom! </span></h2><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">She scrunched up her eyes and opened them up again but not without having to blink multiple times to really adjust to her location: The Dance (it&rsquo;s capitalized since that was the official name of the event - cut the dance committee some slack, they were on a tight schedule and anyone who&rsquo;s been in a group project know it&rsquo;s almost impossible to decide on a moniker.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All jokes aside, Roseanne thought it was absolutely breathtaking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the group was first dropped off by Daniel and Aubrey on the curb where they were briefly encountered with the principal, Rose was delightedly shocked when her dance &ldquo;dates&rdquo; brought out a magnificent bouquet of white chamomiles and violet perennial flowers that went glamorously with her dress. If the thoughtful action wasn&rsquo;t all, Aurora took one look at her gaping and loving facial expression and reassured her, &ldquo;Queen, you deserve all of the flowers.&rdquo; She gave such a pointed look and sounded so modest that Rose made sure to thank both of them innumerable times. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">Subsequent to what Fylnn called your &ldquo;Cinderella&rsquo;s fashionable late arrival to the &lsquo;ball,&rsquo;&rdquo; the three of you speed-walked the rest of the way to the auditorium where they could hear a random pop song being blasted. In contrast to the cinematic entrance main characters usually have in movies and shows when they walk through the doors, such a thing was not present in this situation but that didn&rsquo;t make them any less eager to join their peers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were alluring and aura-setting LED lights plastered onto the top corners of the walls, sparkly and glittering prom dresses - a sharp contrast to the majority of guys wearing basic black and white suits they were probably handed by their moms who got it from her husband&rsquo;s closet. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">There was a disco ball because of course there was.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">Rose could make out some non-twinkling footwear and could guess it was probably the girls on the basketball team wearing Nikes. And as the last few lyrics of Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s &ldquo;good 4 u&rdquo; were sung, she saw Aurora go up to the DJ and whisper something into her ear and the sound technician nodded with a smile and said a few words Rose couldn&rsquo;t decipher. She frowned in suspicion and glanced at Flynn who shrugged in response, but just as Aurora joined them again, they didn&rsquo;t have a second to voice their skepticism when what seemed to be the song she told the DJ started playing in all speakers earning multiple </span><span class="c3">whoos </span><span class="c1">from students, approving her choice. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">And I can take you for a ride</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">It was Dua Lipa&rsquo;s </span><span class="c13 c7">Levitating</span><span class="c1">, one of the trio&rsquo;s favorite songs which they listened to until the beat and melody was engraved into the memory part of their brain. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">Where the music don&#39;t stop for life</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">Rose and Flynn broke out into possibly the widest grins in all of that day and simultaneously elevated a crooked eyebrow at their mutual friend who put on a proud smirk. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">Shining just the way I like</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">The pair rolled their eyes good-naturedly and seized their yelping friend and started dancing on the dance floor - laughing, bumping into each other, executing poor excuses of disco dance moves.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3">If you&#39;re feeling like you need a little bit of company, You met me at the perfect time</span><span class="c1">!&rdquo; They all sang together, not caring if couples made up of the cheer squad girls and football team guys were giving them weird looks or if they were off-tone. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">You want me, I want you, baby</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;, Flynn sang, pointing at the two girls and then himself to match up with the lyrics, his actions making all of them laugh. Rose took off her hair clip and ran her hands through her brown curls as the strands on her head blurred her vision and covered up streaks of the room. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">My sugarboo, I&#39;m levitating,</span><span class="c7">&rdquo; Aurora sang next, cupping her cheeks and doing a funny shimmy, her face turning into a red shade. Rose tucked in a few of the flowers from the bouquet into her hair and imagined what she would probably look like if she had a mirror - disheveled brown hair, pretty lavender attire, flowers everywhere (behind the ear, tied to her bracelet, and even under the straps of her cloth), and an antique emerald necklace - she most likely looked like a carbon copy of a younger </span><span class="c3">Nonna</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">The Milky Way, we&#39;re renegading, Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;, Rose yelled last, pointing her finger up to the ceiling as if the world was watching her relieve herself in euphoria like she was in a coming-of-age movie. </span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">&ldquo;</span><span class="c3 c6">I got you, moonlight, you&#39;re my starlight</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">I need you all night, come on, dance with me</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">I&#39;m levitating</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">You, moonlight, you&#39;re my starlight (you&#39;re the moonlight)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3 c6">I need you all night, come on, dance with me</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3">I&#39;m levitating</span><span class="c1">!&rdquo; That was Adaline&rsquo;s mantra for the rest of the day. </span></p><p class="c2 c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c7">And even as she could hear the rhythm and pulse of the song bleed out into the next, she imagined it: going home with messy hair and her adrenaline high friends to change into cotton sweats matching those of her parents and lending sets to her friends, foretelling that they&rsquo;d stay the night. They&rsquo;ll order at least 3 pizzas and Chinese takeout, play a queue of the best Buzzfeed Unsolved episodes, make the impulse commitment to baking a cake for dessert and stay up all night accompanied by Rose&rsquo;s &ldquo;11:11 on a saturday night&trade;&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardcore vibes&rdquo; playlist on Spotify. And when they all watch the sunrise with less than four percent energy left, her dad will lean in closer than he&rsquo;s already holding her and say another inspirational quote with undeniable confidence like, &ldquo;</span><span class="c13 c7">Enjoy the space between where you are and where you are going</span><span class="c7">&rdquo; or, &ldquo;</span><span class="c13 c7">some things break your heart but fix your vision</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;. Both things his mother said to him. </span></p><p class="c2 c10 c11"><span class="c7 c12"></span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c3">It was ironic, really. </span><span class="c12 c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c8 c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c6 c4 c8">Rocket Man </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">BAM!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan went flying across the hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vision went blurry. His head felt like a hundred elephants were dancing on it. It was going to burst soon. Where was a teacher when you needed them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan could just barely make out Sam&rsquo;s shape, towering above him. Sam had had his growth spurt a while ago. Jonathan had not had his at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, Sam,&rdquo; he managed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing your homework.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BANG!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrong answer. He was kicked even further down the hall. He thought that blood was going down his face now. He couldn&rsquo;t be sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew he was crying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop it, stop it, stop it, why me? he thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just further proof, as if he needed more, that the universe hated him and would very much like for him to die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wimp,&rdquo; said Sam. It was no mere taunt. He sounded genuinely disgusted. BANG! Another twenty feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all those kids were just standing and watching!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan thought he heard Principal Carter come down the hall. He must have seen how bad Jonathan was, because he sounded really mad at Sam. A twinge of satisfaction emerged, promptly buried by Jonathan&rsquo;s pain. Then, rather suddenly, he had a powerful urge to get back at Sam personally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would get his chance someday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jonathan&rsquo;s fight with Sam left him with a black eye, swollen blue-purple bruises all over his arm, and a bloody gash above his right eyebrow.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">As if there wasn&rsquo;t enough wrong with his body already.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">Because of all the damage Sam had done, they had to send Jonathan home from school early. And it wasn&rsquo;t like anyone was going to pick him up either. His mother was at work, his father was on a business trip in the Roman Empire, and his sister was off in New York City. So he, fifteen years old and practically defenseless, had to slog home by himself in the middle of one of America&rsquo;s most dangerous cities, where the buildings towered high and cast long shadows and some goon could jump him any second.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">San Francisco, the Landlocked City. Once a paradise, now a prison.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t like people were better off anywhere else, either. If anything, places like Miami and Chicago were worse. But San Francisco was certainly up there. </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">In his history classes, Jonathan had always learned of an ancient time called the Light Ages. That was when America was one of the most prosperous places in the world. But then the Shuffling came, and the Truth, that primal force that is all things, wreaked havoc upon the world. Continents rearranged and smashed into each other. San Francisco, once a port, became entirely landlocked. People died by the millions. It has been estimated that only 15% of the world&rsquo;s population was left alive.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">Before the Shuffling, there were eight billion people in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">After the Shuffling, only two billion were left.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">People called it the next Permian Extinction. As it occurred, over those two tortured weeks, prophets of death crowded city streets, saying that the end times were here. They were correct. It really was here. And then they themselves would succumb to a chasm that would appear in the road, tearing it apart, and they would fall through, never to be seen again.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">At the end of those fateful two weeks, the world had been forever changed. Old governments collapsed and new ones rose. The United States of America managed to remain more or less intact, but forever scarred. Much of the nation&rsquo;s infrastructure had collapsed, and cities became lawless pits of death. It took five years for the government to band together again, and another five years for everything to come under control. But things could never be the same again. The Light Ages were gone. And the world&rsquo;s political landscape had been forever altered. All the continents had been mashed together into a new Pangaea. Italy conquered its surroundings and established the Great Roman Empire. Britain was swiftly conquered by Ireland, until only Yorkshire remained and established the Kingdom of Yorkshire, with York as its capital. China was reduced to Beijing and its immediate vicinity as Japan, India, Russia, Kazakhstan all staked their claims on the continent. And there were hundreds of other developments that nobody could remember, not even the old, stuffy scholars from Columbia who wrote the history books used by the high schools.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">Now it was the year 341 After the Cataclysm. Jonathan, walking down the street, remembered all of this and made an odd face. It was a strange half-smile, half-grimace, half-amused, half-depressed, and it made him look like an insane person. He had thought he had problems, but as he imagined the life of a person who might have lived through the Shuffling, his own problems suddenly felt unbelievably small. A person living through those two weeks might have seen their entire family die, and all he had was a bully on his tail. A vicious one, but still just a bully.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">Jonathan walked and brooded with the half-smile-half-grimace plastered on his face for half an hour before he arrived at his destination &ndash; the Grumman Coffee Shop, where his mom worked as a barista. </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">He walked through the door. The bell on the door jangled, marking his entry. All the patrons turned and smiled when they saw who it was. Jonathan knew all of them personally.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He-ey, it&rsquo;s Scarboy,&rdquo; said one of them, a hulking, muscular man with tattoos all over his arms. Biltern. But he didn&rsquo;t mean it as an insult. It was an endearment. Biltern had been calling Jonathan that since he was little. He had come to accept it.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Biltern,&rdquo; said Jonathan with a wave. He couldn&rsquo;t help but touch the source of the nickname afterward &ndash; a humongous burn scar on the right side of his face, from the top of his head to almost the bottom, smudging over his eye. It had happened when he was five. He was exploring the street around his apartment, and someone was having a party with fireworks. He didn&rsquo;t remember what happened very clearly, but his friend Alan, who had been with him, had told him afterward that a massive firework flew straight at him and exploded a foot away from his face. Third-degree burns. Hospitalization. The scar would never go. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan was thinking about that, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went over to his mom, who was behind the counter and preparing a cappuccino for Joe Krueger. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, honey,&rdquo; said Jonathan&rsquo;s mom distractedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, mom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a second for Jonathan&rsquo;s mom to realize that school let out an hour later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you &ndash;&rdquo; she turned, saw Jonathan&rsquo;s face, and gasped, nearly dropping the cappuccino. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; said Jonathan, laughing. &ldquo;I got some more scars home, Mom. How d&rsquo;you like them, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Honey!&rdquo; She practically threw the cappuccino at Joe Krueger, rushed to Jonathan, and gave him a hug. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened to you?&rdquo; she said. The concern in her voice was so great that Jonathan felt like it was reaching out, solidifying, and smothering him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing, Mom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sam Wilson beat me up again because I didn&rsquo;t do his homework. He&rsquo;s a rat. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; She was practically screaming by now. &ldquo;Look at yourself! You have a black eye, a gash, and your arm &ndash; why, it&rsquo;s practically turned blue!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Mom. What could possibly be worse than this?&rdquo; He indicated his scar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Jonathan&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re alright? You don&rsquo;t want me to take you to Holy Hospital? It&rsquo;s only a half-hour cycle ride, you know, we could still go &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, really,&rdquo; said Jonathan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen, you still have to work. I can go home and wait there. I&rsquo;ll be fine. I can call Ms. Shelley and Mr. Cody for the rest of my homework, you know, from the classes I missed. I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;m not so sure. You&rsquo;re hurt, you should probably stay here &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, I walked here myself. The school is a half hour away. I&rsquo;ll be fine. Really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so Jonathan Darrow, fifteen years old and already scarred by life, left Grumman&rsquo;s Coffee Shop and set out for his apartment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey would change his life forever.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jonathan&rsquo;s apartment was a forty-five minute walk from Grumman&rsquo;s. He walked with his hands in his pockets, his head down, and his hood up. It was the least conspicuous pose a person could assume &ndash; a sure-fire way of avoiding confrontation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confrontation could be deadly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan walked into an alleyway. It was a dark, secluded one, not the type you would normally want to find yourself in, but it was a great shortcut home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Jonathan felt woozy. His mind clouded, but he was still somewhat aware that he had just fallen on his knees and collapsed to the ground. He then felt something lift off of his body &ndash; his pants, his jacket, he really hoped it wasn&rsquo;t his pants &ndash; and then it fell back down on him again. Definitely his jacket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the evil fog in his brain cleared, he stood up, and he saw what had caused it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Commander of Truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the King of Truth&rsquo;s cronies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he had money in his hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan looked to the left and saw that his wallet was lying on top of his jacket. He put two and two together, fast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Hey, you! Get back here! Heeeyyy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey! Get back! Hey!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan was notorious in his school for being an absolute beast when it came to sprinting. In a matter of seconds he had caught up to the Truth Commander. He primed himself and pounced, knocking the goon to the ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Give me my money back! Give it back! Give-me-it-back!&rdquo; He punched the goon a few times, then rolled him around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Jonathan felt a great heat. It was as though it was emanating from the body of the Truth Commander. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait. It was. And he could see a faint yellow halo begin to appear as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was bad. Jonathan got to his feet and got ready to run. But then there was an explosion. It knocked him feet and feet into the air, and then he landed on the ground with a violent crash. Pain surged through his body, great pain, greater even than the one from the firework.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing he thought of before he slipped into black was, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">I&rsquo;m dying.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then he woke up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dazed, Jonathan sat up around him. His jacket and his wallet were on the ground next to him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thief was long gone, and &ndash; Jonathan opened his wallet &ndash; yup, with all his money too. He cursed. This was pretty bad. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose any money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan scrambled to his feet. That was a mistake. Pain surged through his body, shot up to his brain, wreaked havoc everywhere, sharp and short and terrible, and he fell right back down to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling, he got up again, slowly this time, and put on his jacket. Then he tucked his wallet into his pocket with great care and took a step &ndash; a single step &ndash; forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was like the world had come crashing down all around him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within milliseconds after Jonathan&rsquo;s feet touched the ground, he was shot forward with a tremendous and violent speed. The world around him turned into a blur as he sped by buildings, people, bikes. Wasn&rsquo;t someone going to stop him? How was nobody noticing this? He must have been out of the alley by now &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bike! A bike was in front of him! Jonathan was inches from the wheel, and the bike was going fast, and he was going fast, and &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sidestepped it and kept going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Jonathan was really scared. How did that happen? How did he dodge a </span><span class="c3">bike? </span><span class="c1">It was like whatever this was was not only increasing his speed, but also making his reflexes better. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he ran into a wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was perfectly fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panicked, Jonathan jumped up, panted, and turned around, expecting fully that someone would come into the alley that he appeared to be in and yell for the police, and the police would swiftly arrive on their speedy bicycles and take him away to Alcatraz for violating traffic laws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was biking along, minding their own business. Housewives carrying their groceries with them, men and women alike coming home from work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which could mean only one thing &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c6">He had run so fast that nobody could even see him.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jonathan walked the rest of the way home in a state of half-panic. The acceleration didn&rsquo;t happen when he just walked now, but if he even so much as jogged, it was all over, at least until he hit another wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was another thing he needed to figure out. How was it that when he hit walls, he felt no pain? And how was it that he suddenly had such superhuman reflexes that he could dodge an oncoming, speeding bicycle? It was all too weird. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, there was a gap in the pavement. From an earthquake. Jonathan jumped over it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world ended again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he went vertical. Air pushed past his body, and all of his sandy brown hair was pushed straight down, and his lips flapped, and his teeth rattled, and he was sure that he was dying, but then he crashed back to Earth again and there was no pain. Nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he realized that he must have jumped the length of a seven-story building, for the building next to him was that tall, and he remembered seeing the top of it at the apex of the jump.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in real trouble.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">San Francisco was in a bad way. It was dilapidated, dirty, run-down, and plagued by crime and mobsters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needed a hero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jonathan Darrow was going to be that hero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been two weeks since Jonathan discovered his powers, and he was beginning to gain control over them. No longer did he catapult forward every time he took a step, no longer did he blast into the air when he jumped an inch. He had also discovered another power &ndash; when he punched something, a mass of power concentrated in his fist and destroyed whatever it connected with in a blinding flash of light. He had reduced a punching bag to feathers with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the entire two weeks, Jonathan came home from school, immediately ran to his room, pulled out a notebook and a pencil, and brainstormed ideas for his new persona. He took inspiration from ancient texts like the Greenlantern Texts and the SpiderMan Texts. They detailed, according to Jonathan&rsquo;s history book, mythical demigods with awesome powers swooping from the skies to save helpless mortals from horrible fates at the hands of specters of death. The powers were similar, although weirder, than the ones that Jonathan was now possessed of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Friday, Jonathan had developed something he could use. A perfect alter-ego. It was called Rocket Man. </span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jonathan reasoned that all of his new powers seemed to just be rocket-propelled versions of normal acts. His jumps and sprints were accelerated, his punches were incredibly powerful, his reflexes and durability had been enhanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan quickly came up with names for his new powers. There was Rocket Jump, there was Rocket Speed, Rocket Strength, Rocket Punch, Rocket Reflexes. Now all he needed was something to disguise himself. In the texts, the demigods&rsquo; costumes were arcane gifts from heaven; but he had none of that. The best he could pull off was a cloth face mask, tinted swimming goggles, a thick sweater, and dark blue pants. It would function.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, Jonathan was ready. His mother would be working full-time at Grumman&rsquo;s, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be back until six in the evening. That meant ten hours to himself to test out his new powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to be sure he would get back to the apartment on time, Jonathan strapped his watch to his wrist. Then he opened the window in his bedroom and jumped out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apartment was nine stories up, so Jonathan was really taking a gamble. Crossing his fingers, he waited until he was half of the distance down, then focused all the surging energy in his body to his feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It worked. He flew. It was exhilarating, the air brushing around his face, pulling down as he flew up. He was thumbing his nose at nature itself. He was breaking all the laws of humanity, and he loved every second of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some two-bit thugs, in a dark alleyway, and they had a guy cornered. Jonathan could see everything from the air, the entire scene. It was bad. The guy was in big trouble if nobody stepped in. He had to help. He angled his body, and he began to plummet down to earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fifteen feet above the ground before the muggers noticed that something was above them. They looked up and nearly fainted from shock. And then Rocket Man was upon them. It was like a fever dream, a strange reverie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BAM! The first goon got a Rocket Punch to the stomach. His buddy dropped the guy to focus on Rocket Man, who took it as an opportunity to sprint to the guy, grab him, and Rocket Jump out of there. They had never had a chance. Rocket Man smirked at the thought. He landed on a rooftop and set the guy down, and he became Jonathan again, snapping out of the crazed war frenzy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He panted, &ldquo;W-w-w-who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Call me Rocket Man,&rdquo; Jonathan said after a second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">What?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask. Can&rsquo;t tell you my real name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, thanks, Rocket Man, but&hellip; you sound like you haven&rsquo;t even reached puberty yet. Are you sure you should be doing this? You know, jumping around rooftops and all that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whaddya mean I haven&rsquo;t reached puberty? I have! Believe me! </span><span class="c3">I have!</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And how did you knock that guy out? He was twice your size? And </span><span class="c3">how did you get up here?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, to tell you the truth&hellip; even I&rsquo;m not sure about that. Still trying to figure it out. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! Uh, I&rsquo;m Albert.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, Albert. D&rsquo;you know if you can get your way down to the ground from here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, probably. There&rsquo;s a staircase over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll leave you here. See ya!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped off, propelled himself down with a burst of energy, and Rocket Jumped into the air.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">In a month, Jonathan was fully accustomed to his new, crime-fighting life, and the press were all over it. The </span><span class="c3">San Francisco Gazette </span><span class="c1">was having the time of their lives reporting about this strange guy in a face mask and goggles, who seemed to possess unearthly powers. But there was still Sam to deal with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam wouldn&rsquo;t let up on Jonathan. And there was not much that Jonathan could do about it either. If he tried to fight Sam, his Rocket Punch would undoubtedly kick in with all that anger and he would knock Sam&rsquo;s guts out. But it was too much to bear, but he could do nothing, and he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, while Jonathan&rsquo;s mother was at work, Jonathan went out and changed into Rocket Man. Rocket Man blasted through San Francisco, looking for some crime to fight, and then he saw somebody &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was being mugged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like Albert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were too many muggings in this city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike with Albert, Rocket Man didn&rsquo;t dive straight down to the alley. Instead, he landed on a nearby rooftop and sat and thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should he save Sam? Sam was his greatest enemy. Sam was the one who beat him up, Sam was the one who forced him to do his homework, he had been doing that kind of thing since they were five years old, Sam &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocket Man struggled to remember, but he knew, he </span><span class="c3">knew, </span><span class="c1">that there was something else that Sam had done. Something that he had forgotten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;just </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blocked </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">IT WAS SAM</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">SAM DID IT</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">HE LIT THE FIREWORK</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">AND POINTED IT ON ME</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">IT WAS ON PURPOSE</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">ALAN TOLD ME IN THE HOSPITAL</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">I REMEMBER </span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">ALL OF IT</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">Why should he save him?</span></p><p class="c0 c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c9 c10 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jonathan shook, trembled uncontrollably. Why should he save Sam? Sam had burned and scarred half of his face. Sam had beaten him up. Sam had done nothing for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that wasn&rsquo;t what being Rocket Man was about. Had Albert done anything for him? He hadn&rsquo;t even </span><span class="c3">known </span><span class="c1">Albert!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sam lit the firework&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sam &ndash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had Sam pinned down now. They were going to kill him and Rocket Man was not going to let anybody die if he could help it. He had made up his mind. He was not Jonathan now, and he had no knowledge of all that Sam had done to Jonathan. He jumped. He dove.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BANG</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocket Punch!

How dumb do you have to be not to figure that out &ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. </span><span class="c3">Who are you?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I told you!

In a fit of anger, and he really didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing, he ripped off the mask and snapped the goggles up to his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam gasped, and fell, and scurried back. &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">You?</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s me. You know, the guy you scarred? The guy whose face you shot a firework into? The guy you beat up to get to do your homework?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I&rsquo;m sorry! I was five!

Sam could sense it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Get out,&rdquo; Jonathan said. He whipped his hand towards the staircase. &ldquo;Go. Now. Go. GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sam ran, and he left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan touched the scar. It was so long ago. Ten years. And he was still feeling the aftereffects. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had saved someone he hated. Someone who had wrecked him. Funny. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was still more crime to fight. Always. And revenge had no place there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocket Man &ndash; Jonathan &ndash; snapped the goggles over his eyes, put up the mask, and jumped off into the sunset.</span></p><p class="c9 c11"><span class="c8 c6 c4"></span></p></body></html>

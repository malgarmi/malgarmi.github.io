It affects the nervous system and people </span><span class="c2">are</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;very likely to die because of it. Those who survived were hospitalized and left paralyzed. </span><span class="c0">One of the most famous people to have been affected by polio was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, better known as FDR, who contracted the potentially fatal virus in 1921. For almost the whole rest of his life, FDR would either walk with steel braces or sit in a wheelchair. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">When the vaccine emerged, every person took it. This prevented polio from spreading so well that the last case happened in the 1980s. In 2018, there were only three countries with live polio. </span><span class="c2">However, in New York the appearance of polio in an unvaccinated adult and contaminated sewer water has caused the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, to declare &ldquo;... a State disaster emergency for the entire State of New York through October 9, 2022&hellip;&rdquo;, according to Executive Order 21.</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.qh9w4oxcx9o2"><span class="c6">The Recent Occurrence</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polio has now once again reappeared in sewage and an unvaccinated adult. The individual tested positive for a poliovirus that had been in circulation since the 1990s. &nbsp;According to </span><span class="c2">New York state Health Commissioner Mary Basset</span><span class="c2">t, &ldquo;Based on earlier polio outbreaks, New Yorkers should know that for every one case of paralytic polio observed, there may be hundreds of other people infected &hellip; the department is treating the single case of polio as just the tip of the iceberg of much greater potential spread.&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">Polio could very well start another menacing threat to our country as it did in the 1940s. This recent detection of polio has caused many scientists to urge New Yorkers to get vaccinated. Since many don&rsquo;t know what polio is, less than 70% of kids in some neighborhoods are vaccinated. This puts infants at a much higher risk, which could cause this virus to jump from host to host rapidly. In addition, the absence of a direct </span><span class="c2">cure</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;shows the importance of the vaccine. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">This disease&rsquo;s most severe symptom is paralysis, something that can lead to permanent disability and death. Even children who may seem like they recovered from polio</span><span class="c2">, can develop muscle pain, weakness or paralysis as adults 15-40 years later. The public needs to spread the word of vaccines so that we can protect the world&rsquo;s children and stop this dangerous virus from killing again. Polio was so big of an issue in the 1950s that about</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;300,000 to 400, 000 &nbsp;people got infected each </span><span class="c2">year</span><span class="c0">. This clearly shows why an emergency was widely declared.</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.9j3e005zdwwc"><span class="c9">T</span><span class="c9">he History of Polio</span></h2><p class="c17"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several polio epidemics occurred from 1948 to 1955, before a vaccine was available. People were so scared of the virus that they avoided any crowded, public places and regularly checked their children for symptoms. More than 2 thousand people had died and everyone was terrified. According to </span><span class="c11 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.history.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1664760182592713&amp;usg=AOvVaw3slnJMWF8gWu6tTB9fMn92">History.com</a></span><span class="c0">, a 1952 survey found that Americans feared only nuclear annihilation more than polio. This shows that polio was a major issue on many people&#39;s minds. Thousands of people were worried that their children or they could contract polio to the point of spraying their properties with pesticide!</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 340.50px; height: 54.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 340.50px; height: 54.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 220.00px; height: 174.91px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 220.00px; height: 174.91px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Parents forbade their children from playing with new friends &ndash; much like we did when the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Polio could be very dangerous. If it is not controlled in time, it could be a serious problem, and more epidemics could happen.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Polio is transmitted to humans through ingestion. It travels through the blood supply to the nerves, This is how it enters the nervous system, and infects the cells that help the muscles work. The virus of poliomyelitis is ingested by infected water, infected food, or a contaminated needle on injections. Poliovirus affects the muscle system by wasting the muscles, which is a major source of disability.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 283.00px; height: 217.61px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 316.00px; height: 237.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">.</span><span class="c2">`</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.gauwa6liniiy"><span class="c9">The Efforts to End Polio</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The vaccines and initiatives helped control new cases and prevent spread. In later years, organizations across the world helped make the vaccines available to the vast majority of the population across the world spreading awareness of polio as we are doing now. One especially important organization is the Rotary Organization, who helped found the Global Polio Initiative. Other initiatives have happened since the 1938 March of Dimes, which started the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. &nbsp;All of these efforts had apparently ended polio. Even the WHO had said, &ldquo;... 99 percent of cases have fallen.&rdquo; Even though it was true in the 1950s, polio has appeared again.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">The vaccines and initiatives</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are helping control new cases and prevent spread</span><span class="c2">. Organizations across the world are making vaccines available to the vast majority of the population across the world spreading awareness of polio.

These campaigns are making huge impacts for countries such as Afghanistan where much of the infantine population is battling polio.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 340.50px; height: 272.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 340.50px; height: 272.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 298.00px; height: 38.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 298.00px; height: 38.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c9 c21"></span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.2pgcxyx5u3kk"><span class="c6">Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c2">Polio is a fatal disease that stretches its history back to the ancient time, however, it has had its rises and falls since the 1900&rsquo;s.

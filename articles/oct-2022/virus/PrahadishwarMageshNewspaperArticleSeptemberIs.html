class="c0">Interview By: Arjun Mathur</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.nx3ulsr0dpbv"><span class="c14">Introduction</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a terrible disease that affected many people and terrified the rest. It had affected the nervous system and people were very likely to die because of it. Those who survived were hospitalized and left paralyzed. When the vaccine emerged, every person took it. This prevented polio from spreading so well that the last case happened in the 1980&#39;s. In 2018, there were only three countries with live polio. However in New York, water has become contaminated with polio causing the New York governor to declare a state of emergency.</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.qh9w4oxcx9o2"><span class="c11">The Recent Occurence</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Polio has now once again reappeared in sewage and an unvaccinated adult. According to New York state Health Commissioner Mary Bassett, &ldquo;Based on earlier polio outbreaks, New Yorkers should know that for every one case of paralytic polio observed, there may be hundreds of other people infected &hellip; the department is treating the single case of polio as just the tip of the iceberg of much greater potential spread.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">Polio could very well start another menacing threat to our country as it did in the 1940s. This disease&rsquo;s most severe symptom is paralysis, something that can lead to permanent disability and death. Even children who may seem like they recovered from polio</span><span class="c4">, can develop muscle pain, weakness or paralysis as adults 15-40 years later. The public needs to spread the word of vaccines so that we can protect the world&rsquo;s children and stop this dangerous virus from killing again. To show just how big the amount of people that have been killed by polio, about 300, 000 to 400, 000 &nbsp;people got infected each </span><span class="c4">year polio</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was raging and spreading further. About 10% piling up to about 35,000 people per year. </span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.9j3e005zdwwc"><span class="c11">The History of Polio</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most famous people to have been affected by polio was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, better known as FDR, who contracted the potentially fatal virus in 1921. According to Michael E. Ruane, a reporter for the Washington Post, &ldquo;He [FDR] had felt sick the day before </span><span class="c4">[he caught polio]</span><span class="c4">. After hours of sailing and swimming, his legs began to ache. He developed an uncontrollable shiver and had gone to bed early. Now, he was worse. He had a fever of 102, and as he struggled across the hall, his left leg gave way beneath him&hellip; </span><span class="c4">On that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;morning&hellip; the man who would lead the United States through the Great Depression and World War II, was experiencing the first crippling symptoms of polio.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This excerpt illustrates just how dangerous polio can be. Before FDR was infected with it, polio had been considered an &ldquo;infantile paralysis,&rdquo; since it had mostly only infected children. This was obviously untrue, as a 39-year old man had just caught this virus and become paralyzed. For almost the whole rest of his life, FDR would either walk with steel braces or sit in a wheelchair.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several polio epidemics occurred from 1948 to 1955, before a vaccine was available. People were so scared of the virus that they avoided any crowded, public places and regularly checked their children for symptoms. Parents forbade their children from playing with new friends &ndash; much like we did when the COVID-19 pandemic began. People whose lungs were paralyzed were placed in machines known as iron lungs, which helped them breathe when their own lungs had failed them. Fortunately, Dr. Jonas E. Salk and his colleagues had been working on developing a polio vaccine since 1952. Three years later, the vaccine was licensed in the U.S., and a second vaccine, developed by Dr. Albert B. </span><span class="c4">Sabin, was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;licensed in 1961. A third vaccine was licensed in 1963. In 1994, polio was considered to be nonexistent in North and South America, but now we know that this is unfortunately not the case. Obviously, polio has risen again.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 491.50px; height: 287.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 491.50px; height: 287.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.b00ajjnh5v05"><span class="c11">How Dangerous is Polio?</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Polio is a very threatening and contagious illness that lives in New York State. </span><span class="c4">In its most severe form, it can cause nerve injury (or paralysis), difficulty breathing and even death</span><span class="c28">.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The severity of this disease can occur when this virus is involved in the higher centers of the brain which can result in severe respiratory failure and an irregular heart beat. Once a patient has been infected with both monkeypox and COVID, the patient&rsquo;s immunity will go down, and this virus can take the upper hand and result in severity, as described. It specifically affects the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord [central nervous system]. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Polio is transmitted to humans through ingestion. It travels through the blood supply to the nerves, This is how it enters the nervous system, and infects the cells that help the muscles work. The virus of poliomyelitis is ingested by infected water, infected food, or a contaminated needle on injections. Poliovirus affects the muscle system by wasting the muscles, which is a major source of disability. That&rsquo;s how it gives rise to a disability and when it involves the brain, it can give rise to serious problems of respiratory and cardiac. The symptomatology of polio consists of weakness in the muscles, so that the person finds difficulty in walking, and when it progresses to muscle wasting, the person is totally bedridden or crippled. Polio could be very dangerous. If it is not controlled in time, it could be a serious problem, and more epidemics could happen.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 283.00px; height: 217.61px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 316.00px; height: 237.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c0">`</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.m7d2v5986u6m"><span class="c11">The Efforts to End Polio</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In the summer of 1949, more than 50 thousand people in the United States were infected with polio.

This shows that polio was a major issue on many people&#39;s minds. Thousands of people were worried that their children or themselves could contract polio to the point of spraying their properties with pesticide!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Scientists were busy trying to make cures during</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">these epidemics</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;One of these machines created was the iron lung, which stimulated breathing for the patient.

The oral vaccine was preferred in the world, </span><span class="c28">while</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the Salk vaccine was preferred in the USA. The vaccines were successful and were mass produced by initiatives.

In later years, organizations across the world helped make the vaccines available to the vast majority of the population across the world spreading awareness of polio as we are doing now. One especially important organization was the Rotary Organization, who helped found the Global Polio Initiative. Other initiatives have happened since the 1938 March of Dimes, which started the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. &nbsp;All of these efforts had apparently ended polio. Even the WHO had said, &ldquo;... 99 percent of cases have fallen.&rdquo; Even though it was true in the 1950s, polio has appeared again.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 340.50px; height: 272.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 340.50px; height: 272.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="t.26cbe8e34c0a7ea52e5a12dcf748c6c71b374d43"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c7"><tr class="c21"><td class="c22" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Nurses helping patients in iron lungs fight polio.</span></p></td></tr></table><h2 class="c18" id="h.z71w26jp2hhc"><span class="c14">How</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;to Prevent Polio</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The biggest thing you can do to prevent getting polio is getting one of the two vaccines, both of which help decrease the risk of contracting polio. However, many Americans who came after the polio period have not gotten the vaccine, making large segments of our population susceptible to Polio. Another thing you can do to end polio, is to provide good health services and check for polio in food and water (more information is mentioned in the interview below). All of these can help stop polio. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 381.50px; height: 284.82px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 381.50px; height: 284.82px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.n10t333kcob"><span class="c16">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c14">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c11">Interview </span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c13">&nbsp;The Profile of Poliomyelitis with Dr. C.K. Mathur, Senior Consultant, Physician, Specialist, and Professor of Medicine </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13">Q: Did you ever have a patient with polio?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: I have worked in an infectious diseases hospital in Hyderabad, and I have treated cases of poliomyelitis [polio]. That&rsquo;s how I know about this disease. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13">Q: Besides getting vaccinated, is there any way to prevent catching polio?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: You see, first and foremost in any disease, prevention by way of avoiding contamination and leading a healthy lifestyle is best. When there is an epidemic, the virus can spread, so you have to contain it by way of immediate medical care. We have to prevent the spread of the epidemic by preventing the spread of infection, which we can do by implementing perfect health services. We must also provide wholesome food, keep the environment clean, check the contamination of water and food during the epidemic, and, finally, avoid receiving injections. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13">Q: How can polio be treated?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A: As mentioned above, before catching the infection, one has to prevent it. This is also a step in treatment. To prevent polio, one should have a perfect health service system at one&rsquo;s disposal and &nbsp;also avoid getting injections during an epidemic. Polio can also be prevented by getting the polio vaccine, which was earlier given by injectable root [Salk and Sabin invented this vaccine], but it was avoided after it was discovered that injections transmit polio. Now, we give oral polio vaccines to newborns, which we later on administer as a follow-up when the patient is nine years of age to boost the immunity. Once polio has affected a person, it can give rise to muscle wasting and disability, so after the active phase has subsided, one must plan to preserve power in the muscle group which is affected by getting physiotherapy with regular planned exercises. In very severe cases where there is a permanent disability, like foot drop, we can plan for reconstructive surgery [like tendon transplantation]. This is not done during the active phase; this is only done after the active phase has passed on. Physiotherapy and surgery is for chronic cases, because the patients should have a quality of life &ndash; with this they can walk again.</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.wfg054jbfwuh"><span class="c11">Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Polio is a fatal disease that stretches its history back to the ancient time, however, it has had its rises and falls since the 1900&rsquo;s. Vaccines and better health treatments for those paralyzed have prevented the spread of polio and eventually many countries have eliminated polio. However in recent years, people have been taking this infection less seriously, causing many countries to get affected by polio again such as the United States.

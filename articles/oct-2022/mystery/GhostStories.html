The city&rsquo;s coroner later confirmed that Kate had shot herself and her dead body lay on the staircase of the hotel.

But who knows what might be lurking in the shadows. &nbsp;There have been several cases of employees witnessing people disappearing into thin air and ghosts spotted roaming around the boat.

According to travelandleasure.com, Walter J. Adamsonin, a 3rd class person who booked this room, died in 1948 in this specific room. No one to this day knows the cause of his death. Also, employees would report that the water would randomly turn on and the lights would start to flicker. All of that happened in </span><span class="c24">this</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">room. One woman saw a man disappearing into thin air in front of her bed! Then there is also the first-class swimming pool, which is the most popular place to have paranormal activity. This may not be real, but some people have spotted a woman wearing a wedding gown sitting next to a young boy in a suit. Then there is a middle-aged woman in a tennis outfit with a racket. Then finally, there is a little girl that only appears for a few seconds and then disappears. The girl also appears in the boiler with an old ragged teddy bear. Another matter was in the Mayfair Roo</span><span class="c2">m</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">where a woman was working and cleaning. She felt a slight brush up on her chair while sitting down to rest. She also says that she felt unusually cold until she saw a transparent figure walking across the room and roaming around. She rushed out of the room and reported the figure.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 263.43px; height: 200.59px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 263.43px; height: 200.59px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4 c19"><span class="c2 c10"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22">The Niles Canyon Ghost/ The White Witch</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c1">Every year on February 26th, a woman in white can be seen near Niles Canyon and around the Sunol area. She&rsquo;s been called many different names over the years, most notably the &ldquo;White Witch &#39;&#39; as well as the &ldquo;Niles Canyon Ghost&#39;&#39;, and the story around her has been retold many times, with the fear invoked to whoever hears about the tale remaining the same every time.</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c1">One story is the &ldquo;Vanishing Hitchhiker&rdquo; type. Since February 26th, 1938 (the first time this specific story was told), a woman in a white gown can be seen near the side of Niles Canyon road asking to be driven to a San Francisco address, many picking her up. However, everyone that has taken her in says that she disappeared out of their car once they reached the Dumbarton Toll Plaza, never to be seen by them again. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c2">Another story goes that a woman was killed when she was coming from her wedding at the intersection next to where Highway 84 meets Highway. Victoria Christian, a Fremont resident, lists in her memoir &ldquo;Around Sunol&rdquo; that this story along with many others have been retold for generations. The woman was riding in the night, when her carriage&rsquo;s horses were all of a sudden shocked, launching the carriage with her in it. This ultimately killed her. Now, she can be seen at her death site wearing the same wedding gown she died in.<br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 297.50px; height: 297.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 297.50px; height: 297.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Conclusion</span><span class="c16"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T</span><span class="c2">he three locations written about here are just a fraction of the many areas that have experienced supernatural, haunted activities.

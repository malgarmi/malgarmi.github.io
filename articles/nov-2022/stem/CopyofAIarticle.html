Also known as artificial intelligence, AI is defined as robots that do plenty of simple, everyday tasks. This includes chatbots such as Alexa, Siri and Google Home. AI has been mentioned and developed by many, known as the founding fathers of this field. They made major contributions and advancements bringing us where we are today. Everybody, everywhere is now impacted by AI in some way, by either preventing car accidents or replacing family members. Artificial intelligence, even with its mad inventions, has its fair share of both pros and cons impacting everyone all over the world and changing the way people live.</span></p><h2 class="c12 c22" id="h.tjqfotsbul1"><span class="c4 c0">The Founding Fathers of AI</span></h2><h2 class="c12 c22" id="h.kw4iylf1au57"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 266.00px; height: 176.39px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 266.00px; height: 176.39px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h2><p class="c14"><span class="c1">How did AI come to be? AI was developed by many such as Alan Turing, Allen Newell, Herber A. Simon, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky. Today, AI is used in multiple fields such as business, personal life, government, and much more.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">The first idea of artificial intelligence came from Alan Turing in 1935, nearly 90 years ago. Turing led the British Government to crack German codes during World War II using a form of AI. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Next, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. Newell came together as the computer era began and founded the world&rsquo;s first hub dedicated to studying artificial intelligence. Some of the work developed here included the General Problem Solver, a universal problem solver. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Lastly, came Marvin Minsky, a steady believer that a human mind was no different than a computer&rsquo;s. Such belief kept him motivated in engineering intelligent machines and led to his several groundbreaking inventions such as the robotic arm and grabbers, widely used throughout the world today. </span></p><h2 class="c12" id="h.6cvhjx93e71g"><span class="c0">Pros of AI</span></h2><p class="c14"><span class="c2">To start, AI taking control of vehicles will save lives by preventing careless mistakes humans make. In fact, in the 20th century, 60 million people were killed on the roads, about as much as an extra World War of deaths! The National Transportation and Safety Board has identified human error as the cause of 94% of accidents, while these errors are impossible for a machine to make. Humans make mistakes such as drunk driving and not paying attention to the road in front of them. In addition, every year when people are backing out of driveways or parking spaces, in the U.S., up to 200 people are killed. In the end, it comes down to the fact we don&rsquo;t have eyes in the back of our heads, and even cameras have blind spots. But if you have an AI that uses something like LiDAR (</span><span class="c0 c7">Li</span><span class="c2">ght </span><span class="c0 c7">D</span><span class="c2">etection </span><span class="c0 c7">a</span><span class="c2">nd </span><span class="c0 c7">R</span><span class="c1">anging), which according to NASA is, &ldquo;a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges to earth&rdquo;, you will not hit people on the road.</span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 361.50px; height: 204.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 361.50px; height: 204.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Furthermore, these technologies have much more training than the average human. These vehicles have way more experience than any human driver, with about 20 million miles of driving on public roads. It would take a human about 1,000 years to accumulate that kind of experience. Waymo is a popular vehicle that has gained about 6.1 million miles of driving in an Arizona town. Of the 18 accidents Waymo experienced, 3 of them were related to pedestrians, and all involved the pedestrian driving straight toward a stationary Waymo that was stopped. This shows AI has nothing to do with potentially fatal accidents.</span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 338.70px; height: 338.70px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 338.70px; height: 338.70px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">AI also gives digital assistance to humans. Corporations use this AI even in the present day to interact with customers. &nbsp;These chatbots create a rising voice bot to help with queries.&rdquo; This shows how AI is very important in chatbots. According to forbes.com, &ldquo;Chatbots use artificial intelligence to hold real-time conversations with customers, build brand credibility and boost engagement.&rdquo; Chatbots help organizations grow and expand.</span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 318.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 318.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Also, AI is capable of &ldquo;bringing back the dead&rdquo; through a chatbot. For example, Joshua Barbeau, who lives in Bradford, Canada, used a hyper-advanced chatbot called Project December to simulate a conversation with his deceased fiance&eacute;, Jessica Pereira, who died 10 years ago of rare liver disease. Project December was able to simulate Jessica&rsquo;s personality, and it was like Barbeau was talking to her, not a chatbot. Project December is the first system in the world that uses AI to stimulate a conversation with anyone in the world.

According to </span><span class="c24 c2"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rockcontent.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-pros-and-cons/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667280888948318&amp;usg=AOvVaw3T95O4pM_5kp4jG1pJ67tA">15 Artificial Intelligence Pros and Cons that you Need to Know</a></span><span class="c2">, &ldquo;Relying on AI can cause us to use our brains less to memorize, strategize, and solve issues on our own. The effects this may have on future generations may be vast if left unacknowledged.&rdquo; AI greatly damages our critical thinking. This leaves us to rely on AI for everything. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">Another problem with AI is its price. The complexity of its mechanics and the hardware needed for its management are quite expensive. It also relies on staff to take care of the very expensive AI.According to an article in Forbes,&rdquo; The cost of electricity alone to power on supercharged language model AI was estimated at $4.6 million.&rdquo; This proves that AI can be very expensive, creating problems as shown below.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2 c27">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Furthermore, AI is bound to take many human jobs, causing massive unemployment and in turn, a recession. According to </span><span class="c2 c24"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rockcontent.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-pros-and-cons/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667280888950015&amp;usg=AOvVaw17CrOwqsqk484TTiVaYfC4">15 Artificial Intelligence Pros and Cons that you Need to Know</a></span><span class="c1">,&rdquo; Traditional job roles will be phased away, leading to unemployment of those who do them.

AI has its advantages, such as humans focusing their energy on complicated tasks while leaving simple ones to robots, with the use of chatbots. Artificial intelligence also has several disadvantages, too, since we will become overly dependent on them and in turn, make us quite lazy. From crazy ideas like bringing people back from the dead to having an automated cleaner, AI has had its fair share of absolutely mad ideas, which will either build or destroy our future.</span></p><p class="c14 c26"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c9 c10"></span></p></body></html>

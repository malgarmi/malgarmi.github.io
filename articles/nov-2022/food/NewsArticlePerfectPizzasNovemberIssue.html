We ordered a small pepperoni pizza for $10.99 on the phone and it was ready within twenty minutes. The pizza had a layer of liquid grease on the cheese. It pooled on the cheese as if it were a layer of ice over a lake. The crust was extremely thin and the edges were very crispy. However, the part of the crust with any toppings on it was limp because of the grease.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">If</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;you were to hold it at the end &nbsp;of the crust, it would sag down and have the cheese slowly sludge off.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The crust wasn&rsquo;t doughy, but it definitely wasn&rsquo;t solid. The crust tasted like white bread but had a wet cardboard-like texture. There were exactly six pieces of pepperoni on the whole pizza, which was not what they advertised. In various advertisements, you can see it almost completely covered in pepperoni, like the one below.</span></p><p class="c6 c15 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c10"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 404.00px; height: 288.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 404.00px; height: 288.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6 c24"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c13">&nbsp;The advertised pepperoni pizza at Pieology</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">The cheese was oddly colored. It was almost completely white, but still yellow, like the color of a banana. It was too salty, as if the worker added several spoonfuls of salt onto it.

It was a bit too salty and barely had a meat taste to it.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;It tasted like</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a brown paper bag with lumps of salt and tomato sauce on it.

You can always rely on them when you need a quick lunch pizza. Little Caesars didn&rsquo;t have a small pizza option, so we just bought the regular. The bottom of the pizza was perfect and didn&rsquo;t get in your way while eating your pizza. It wasn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c3">soggy </span><span class="c3">and had a pleasant texture. </span><span class="c3">When held in the air, it sagged around 45 degrees downward, a generally appropriate amount</span><span class="c1">. Even with the cheese being thick, it didn&rsquo;t stretch and was rather stringy, but it still tasted like cheese. The pepperoni is overly salty but is crunchy at the ends. The sauce is chunkier and you can taste the herbs in it. The sauce made the pepperoni taste better and lifted the pizza&rsquo;s overall flavor. The sauce complimented each of the flavors and textures.

The pizza was ready in fifteen minutes. The </span><span class="c3">pepperoni </span><span class="c3">on the pizza was the only part with grease. The pepperoni was so crispy that it curved upwards into a bowl shape. The edges of the pepperoni were lightly brown and crunchy. A key component of the pizza was the overall texture and the fact that the saltiness didn&#39;t overpower the mozzarella flavor. The cheese was thick but still stretchy and yeasty. The cheese had a consistent flavor that was different from the other pizzas because of how it tasted and reminded everyone of bread. But, the crust was the pizza&rsquo;s downfall. The crust was thinly layered. It looked like a stack of flimsy pieces of tagboard thrown on top of each other and tasted like it, too. We found the crust to be thick and difficult to bite. We had to use both hands to rip off a piece of the crust to eat. It was ironic how the </span><span class="c3">cheese tasted more like bread than the actual bread base</span><span class="c3">. If you were to hold the pizza at the crust, it would stay at a one-hundred-eighty-degree angle.

They can vary in different sizes, some being big and others being small. Types of animals can be mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. In their natural habitat, animals can adapt and change. Wildlife can be found in varieties of environments, such as terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric. Animals can provide numerous resources, including some important ones such as meat. Humans can also domesticate animals, making them a part of their daily lives. Learn three unique animals that were discovered in 2022 by reading this article.

The crab was found by a family, who then took it to the Western Australian Museum to learn more about this unusual crab. The species was researched by scientists and was not classified yet.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Ocean and the Western Australian coastlines are home to the </span><span class="c0">Lamarckdromia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beagle. The </span><span class="c0">Lamarckdromia</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">&nbsp;beagle lives in shallow waters few meters deep. The crab hides at the bottom of rocky shorelines for camouflage and protection. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="c0">Lamarckdromia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beagle is a crab that belongs to the Dromiidae family of sponge crabs.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A Dromiidae</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;crab can range in size from being small to medium size. The </span><span class="c0">Lamarckdromia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beagle can have a transportable shelter by living beneath its coat of sponge. The crab also belongs to the family of crustaceans, which are marine organisms that live in shallow seas. Barnacles, lobsters, shrimp, and other sea creatures are examples of crustaceans. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c0">Lamarckdromia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beagle can gather and cut marine sponges and can wear them on its shell. &nbsp;The crab can also have ascidians, known as sea </span><span class="c0">squirters</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">&nbsp;on their shells. The ascidians and marine sponges the crab uses can offer safety. The sponge the crab gathers has chemicals that can cause their predators to flee. The crab&#39;s sponge also serves as a type of camouflage, which can protect the species from predators. The Lamarckdromia beagle, which is coated in a fluffy coat of camouflage, has the greatest fashion choice in my view. What do you think about this crab? Is it properly suited?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c0 c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c4 c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1 c2">Tlalocohyla Celeste</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 215.50px; height: 217.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 215.50px; height: 228.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c0">On a rewilded nature reserve in Costa Rica, the Tlalocohyla Celeste was found. The Tapir Valley Nature Reserve is the name of the reserve. The nature reserve protects creatures like peccaries, jaguars, and baird&rsquo;s tapirs. </span><span class="c0">Donald Valera Soto</span><span class="c0">, the reserve&rsquo;s co-owner, was once working in the wetlands of the nature reserve, until he heard an unfamiliar frog call. Donald talked with a website called, </span><span class="c2 c0 c9 c14">news.mongabay.com</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;and said,</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c9">I kept hearing this different sound in the wetland but was unable to find it</span><span class="c0 c9 c17">.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;He had never heard that sound before, and Donald had searched for the frog for six months, until he discovered it. Donald discovered the species and it was two centimeters long. To identify the new species, Donald had help from herpetologists, researchers who study amphibians and reptiles all around the world. Some people thought it was a canal zone tree frog, another amphibian in Costa Rica, but the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;frog calls </span><span class="c0">of the two species were different. Donald kept looking for the frog, but this time he had a team with him. His team were </span><span class="c0">able</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to discover a male and female frog in an amplexus. An amplexus is a type of mating behavior for some amphibians. They were able to recognize the female&#39;s eggs in the amplexus. Then they had </span><span class="c0">identified</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">&nbsp;the new species after studying the adults and their tadpoles. The new species was named &quot;Celeste&quot;, after a river in Costa Rica, called Rio Celeste. </span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c4 c0 c5">The Tapir Valley Nature Reserve has the Tlalcohyla Celeste&rsquo;s natural habitat, living in a wetland system with herbaceous plants and both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The Tlalcohyla can be found in Costa Rica and in Central America, between Mexico.</span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c4 c0 c5">The Tlalcohyla Celeste is a part of the Hylidae family of Tlalocohylas. The Tlalocohyla Celeste is an amphibian and is a stunning frog that is entirely covered in green. The frog&rsquo;s head, back, and lower limbs are all covered with red dots. Also the skin of the Tlalocohyla Celeste is also somewhat transparent. </span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Otus</span><span class="c1 c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">bikegila</span></p><p class="c8 c10"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 175.50px; height: 175.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 175.50px; height: 175.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8 c10 c12"><span class="c4 c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A small island off the coast of Guinea in Africa, called Principe Island, was where the </span><span class="c0">Otus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(O-Tis-bike-HEE-LUH) was found. The specimen&rsquo;s particular call led to its discovery. Its call resembled a call from an insect that was constantly repeated. On the southern area of the island, the Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be found living in the native forest. The owl was given the name &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Bikegila</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">&#39;&#39; in honor of Ceciliano de Bom Jesus, also known as Bikegila. Ceciliano was a parrot harvester on Principe Island, but now is a ranger, protecting the island&rsquo;s natural park.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the southern area of Principe Island, the Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c4 c0 c5">&nbsp;can be found in its natural habitat living in the native forest.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;belongs to the Strigidae family and is a part of the species of scops-owls. The Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;size is small, but the females are often bigger than the males. The Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be colored in a variety of brown tones, each owl being different. Also, due to the species only on Principe Island, the Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is potentially in serious risk to be an endangered species, which is devastating as the species can be extinct any time soon. Luckily, the forest the owl lives in, is a confined area and can not be entered.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c1 c2 c4">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c0">These were only three examples of the many other unique animals that were discovered in 2022. 1: </span><span class="c0">Lamarckdromia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beagle often called fluffy crab, a type of crab found washed up on a beach in Denmark. 2: Tlalocohyla Celeste or Tapir valley tree frog, a type of frog that was discovered on a rewilded nature reserve in Costa rica. 3: Lastly Otus </span><span class="c0">bikegila</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;also known as the Principe scoop owl, is &nbsp;a type of owl found on Principe Island. </span><span class="c4 c0 c5">There are still many more amazing animals that were discovered in 2022.</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c4 c0 c5"></span></p><div><p class="c12 c13"><span class="c4 c5 c7"></span></p></div></body></html>

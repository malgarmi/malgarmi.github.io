Shein has a variety of options to choose from, there are many different types of clothing and so many different styles. Some of the clothing options to choose from are jeans, sweatpants, t-shirts, crop tops, shorts, pajamas, tank tops, leggings, dresses, bathing suits, and way more. Shein also has the option to choose plus sized clothing, kids clothing, womens clothing and mens clothing and it&#39;s a pretty equal variety. Some of the clothing doesn&#39;t have the best quality but most items are decent. Shein also sells other items such as shoes, accessories, bags, jewelry and more. The prices range between $5-$45 and you earn coupons and discounts the more you purchase an order.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;The average wait time for your shein package to </span><span class="c3">arrive</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is between 1-2 weeks, every clothing item is individually wrapped and is packaged nicely. Overall shein is recommended and is a great online fashion store to shop at, </span><span class="c0">6/10 . </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c8 c11">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Number 4:H&amp;M</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 259.00px; height: 194.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 259.00px; height: 194.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">H&amp;M is a more Low-end/cheaper store than some on this list and generally has okay quality (more on the cheaper end of production), and most people tend to find pleasing items inside the store. Some of the fabrics they use include cotton and Lyocell and leather, and cotton tends to be pretty durable and good in texture. The price of the items generally range between $20-$40 and they have a nice selection of clothing options in the store, ranging from mens, womens, kids - boys and girls, and toddlers. One of the downsides to H&amp;M though is the fact they don&rsquo;t produce their own clothes and ship it out from suppliers in Asia and Netherlands and other parts of Europe so it takes them longer to restock on their items. H&amp;M gets a solid 7/10.</span><span class="c8"><br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Number 3: Zara</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 259.00px; height: 194.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 259.00px; height: 194.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Zara is a popular clothing store with a big array of clothes.

The shop itself has an equal variety of things for men and women so there is rarely any shortage in items for a specific gender and bigger variety for the other. If you don&rsquo;t prefer to use digital currency like a credit/debit card or just don&rsquo;t have one and have a lot of money in dollar bills or $20 bills Hollister takes debit as well as cash and credit so there&rsquo;s always more than 1 payment option available. </span><span class="c3">Student Kylee Kelley says, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">I really like Hollister and the many options it has as well as the really good clearance section.&rdquo; Most students think it deserves a 9/10 </span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c11 c8">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking to Centerville students and asking them about their favorite clothing stores, we were able to rank them.

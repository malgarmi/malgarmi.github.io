Getting assigned lots of assignments every single day caused lots of stress to teens, especially when most of them were always due at 11:59 pm that day. According to </span><span class="c10 c4"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1682372136060707&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZFd7J8UyrXdMJGGAefXJb">https://www.washingtonpost.com/</a></span><span class="c4">&nbsp;teens aged from 14-18 have had a negative impact on their academics caused by the covid-19 lockdown. The online education was sometimes not so organized which caused stress to some students, i</span><span class="c4">nternet problems were also very annoying to deal with especially when you are trying to join a meeting.</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;Since most lessons were on virtual meetings students basically had free range to do whatever they wanted, teachers had no control over students working at home so it made it easier for students to not pay attention or to cheat or to just not do the work. This affects students now because after the year of being online and not taking the work seriously, coming back to in person school was a challenge causing them to be behind and having trouble understanding what&#39;s going on in classes. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c6 c4">Another big challenge with online education was all the distractions. Being at home with siblings and family while trying to do school can be very overwhelming. Lots of teens already struggle with paying attention, so doing online school with your family all at home can make it even worse. Being at home can also make learning more difficult for others because it can be very hard to pay attention when you are at your own house with many other things you&#39;d rather be doing instead of sitting down on a computer doing assignments. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 195.00px; height: 194.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 195.00px; height: 194.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c9">How has Teens Mental Health Been Affected by the Covid-19 Lockdown?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covid 19 has caused teens to miss a whole important year of school, the one year that was missed has affected many teens and left them struggling with mental health problems. A main cause of this is because teens </span><span class="c4">got</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;social interaction taken away from them, not being able to go to school and socialize with people after being used to it your whole life can really change your social skills.

Some teens may still be dealing with problems caused by the lockdown, but thankfully it&#39;s over now. Covid-19 is still a virus that is going around but it&#39;s much more calm now and teens are finally able to go and live their teenager lives without needing to be locked up. Teens are now also able to attend in person school which can help their education go back up. </span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c13"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c6 c18">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c13"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c13"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c13"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c13"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p></body></html>

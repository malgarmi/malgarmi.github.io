The said teams tend to have a minimum of 10 players per team and the positions in volleyball are Setter, Libero, Outside Hitter, Opposite Hitter, and the Middle Blocker. The Setter in volleyball is one of the most used players on teams offense, usually aiding the opposite or outside hitter. The Libero serves as a secondary defense specialist to aid in keeping the ball from touching the ground on their team&rsquo;s side. The Outside Hitter&rsquo;s job is to be a defense for balls that go over the net and as well as be a main passer and final hit in the games. The Opposite Hitter acts as a multi-purpose tool as they can hit from the front and back row but also look for quick attacks and can substitute for setters and set for them if unable. Lastly Middle Blockers act as the first defense against the other team&rsquo;s offense and try to keep the ball from hitting the ground like most players, but most similarly to the libero.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c2">Number 3: Soccer </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 433.50px; height: 433.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 433.50px; height: 433.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c6 c2">Soccer, also referred to as football in many parts of the world, is a globally popular sport played by two teams, each consisting of 11 players.

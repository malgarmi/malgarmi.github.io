School has always served its purpose, to educate children.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">Currently, schools have a lot to offer, such as; sports and meeting diverse people. Not only that but we also have many unique clubs and activities. Did you know that it wasn&rsquo;t like this before? According to </span><span class="c12 c6"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2017/article/history-of-child-labor-in-the-united-states-part-1.htm%23:~:text%3DIn%2520rural%2520areas%252C%2520young%2520boys,the%2520bone%252C%2520breaking%2520up%2520coal.%26text%3DYoung%2520lads%2520in%2520urban%2520areas,regularly%2520employed%2520girls%2520and%2520boys.&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1682371437744465&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Av97ulb1kG_ZCYN12RPDd">Bls.gov</a></span><span class="c6">&nbsp;&ldquo;Kids as young as 10 years old or much younger were working not only in the industrial setting, but even in retail stores, on the streets, or farms, and in home based industries!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">That&#39;s astounding work for such young people.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In many schools (Including our school: Centerville Junior High School) &nbsp;there have been lots of fun activities and clubs being hosted by the school&rsquo;s staff and students. For example, at CJHS; there are clubs like Creative Comic Club, Intramural Club, Dungeons and Dragons club, and even a science club. You may think that only the staff members and the principal can make clubs, then you&rsquo;re completely wrong! Students can also make clubs at our school (though they have to face some documentation first). Clubs are really awesome and exciting. Sadly, clubs and other activities never existed in the past. Before, kids used to do other stuff rather than clubs, like; climb trees, playing with small army sets, and other similar stuff. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c9">Sports, one of the most major known things in school. Anywhere you go, you&rsquo;ll hear most of the people talking about sports such as; basketball, soccer, football, and other sports. Nowadays there are many sports teams in school for boys and girls. For example, let&#39;s take our school, we have a variety of sports teams. According to the official </span><span class="c6 c9 c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://centerville-fusd-ca.schoolloop.com/pf4/cms2/view_page?d%3Dx%26group_id%3D1548491678428%26vdid%3Din039a23g1t77m6&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1682371437745367&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pBnHcLJiccuXChjB-sHcy">Centerville Junior High School Website</a></span><span class="c6 c9">&nbsp;We have &ldquo;Boys Basketball, Girls Basketball, Boys Volleyball, and intramural programs&rdquo;(for intramural sports). Before there were very few sports teams and the main sport played was dodgeball. Dodgeball later on got banned in some schools due to how hard the ball was and how it injured many kids. Other than dodgeball, sports were very limited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">Middle School is a very important milestone in a teen&rsquo;s life and teens have several unique perspectives about how middle school life is to them. Middle school is mostly fine and many people enjoy its advantages. People mostly like to hang out with their friends and play sports and have real fun. Though many others have a bad opinion about middle school or don&rsquo;t love or like it that much. For many kids, Middle school is hard for them, and some kids are pushed by their parents to perform well and other things like that. Another thing that most kids try to deal with is peer pressure and popular people. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">To conclude, school has been around for a large amount of time, since the 1800s, educating children. </span><span class="c6">Nowadays, school has become so advanced and a fun learning environment for many kids and teens and providing many kids with clubs, being able to make friendships with people from diverse religions and even sport teams. </span><span class="c3">In the past kids didn&rsquo;t go to school, instead they worked all day and night, technically this would be child labor in current terms. Kids ages 10 and below had to work in many areas such as; &nbsp;in the industrial setting, but even in retail stores, on the streets, or farms, and in home based industries! Middle school is a child&rsquo;s milestone. Although some students may face some difficulties at school due to peer pressure and constructive criticism from parents, school has become a fun place to enjoy and learn. Nowadays we have better and improved schools, so the next time you go to your class, make sure to thank your teachers for their hard work and dedication to spend time to educate you and your class.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
